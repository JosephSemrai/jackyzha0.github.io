Found out about [100 Rabbits](https://100r.co/site/about_us.html), a tag-team of two people sailing around the world making open-source software\n2. OpenAIs recent work with [DALL-E](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/) and [CLIP](https://openai.com/blog/clip/). Some really revolutionary stuff in combining text and image domains.\n3. Vlogbrothers on [How To Change What you Want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salgtCpST3A). Interesting video on how content we consume steers our wants and what we want to want affects our actual wants. Hank says it in a way that makes a lot more sense so give it a watch.\n\n## 2 things I’ve been wondering about\n\n1. Why didn’t I start writing earlier? Writing has always been a way to help me organize my own thoughts. Now that I’ve started writing more frequently, I feel like I’m able to better put the jumble of thoughts inside my brain onto paper (or I guess a Markdown file in this case).\n2. Promoting healthier [hacking culture](/thoughts/hackathons). Conversation inspired by [this tweet](https://twitter.com/sarahbdhsn/status/1347666496718213120). What can we do as hackathon organizers to make events less stressful/hypercompetitive for attendees (especially those who are differently-abled)?\n\n## 1 thing I’ve done\n\nI wrote a [reflection piece about my 2020](/posts/2020) as well as set some goals for the upcoming year! A few interesting tidbits on paratelic vs telic goal setting.","title":"Hello world!"},"/newsletters/issue-1":{"content":"---\ntitle: \"A request for coffee chats\"\ndate: 2021-01-31T13:43:34-08:00\nissueNum: 1\n---\n\nThis month of January went by with blazing speed. I can't say if it's because of school starting back up or just the massive amounts of s t u f f going on in the world right now. \n\nOn an unrelated note, I'm currently working on stepping outside my comfort zone and meeting new people so feel free to email back if you'd be interested in a coffee chat! I'd be happy to learn about all the cool things y'all are working on :)\n\n## 3 things I’ve found interesting\n\n1. [Velocity vs Acceleration based execution](https://www.samsonzhang.com/2021/01/19/how-to-innovate-and-create-a-culture-of-innovation.html). Insightful read on how orgs can be [moving fast but not be innovating](/thoughts/acceleration). How do we have a high acceleration org rather than just a high velocity one?\n2. [Switch Transformers: Larger than GPT-3](https://venturebeat.com/2021/01/12/google-trained-a-trillion-parameter-ai-language-model).  An interesting approach to deal with huge language models by 'sparsly' activating certain subsets of the network. Interesting to see modern ML techniques going back to expert systems of the early 90's.\n3. [Suspension of Internet in Uganda](https://blog.cloudflare.com/uganda-january-13-2021-internet-shut-down/). During an election at that. Curious how something of this scale was orchestrated, let alone agreed to. Something that feels so close to [infrastructure](/thoughts/infrastructure) shouldn't be freely shutdown so easily.\n\n## 2 things I’ve been wondering about\n\n1. How can we make policy more accessible? Idea has been festering in my head after reading Eva Zhang's post on '[Request for Startups](https://evaz.substack.com/p/rfs)'. Is there a better way we can track what policy makers are up to during non-election years? Maybe some sort of data mesh or platform that simplifies policy or makes it easier to view updates? Decided to take a stab at this problem during HTN2020++ this year. [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/legist).\n2. Digital Gardening. After reading Joel Hook's blog post on his own [digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden), I've been thinking and reflecting on my own processes for managing my garden. It's culminated into a blog post which you can read [here](/posts/digital-gardening).\n\n## 1 thing I’ve done\nI presented a technical workshop for the first time at Hack the North 2020++! I've always been a little spooked of public speaking but it was really empowering to be able to go up in front of so many people (albeit virtually) and talk about something I'm passionate about. My workshop was on a gentle introduction to Docker and you can view the recording [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONNQ5EDhXUk) (it's not a Rick Roll, I promise).\n\n","title":"A request for coffee chats"},"/newsletters/issue-2":{"content":"---\ntitle: \"Spider-man neurons, hearing fractals, and fulfilment\"\ndate: 2021-02-01T13:43:34-08:00\nissueNum: 2\n---\n\nI can't believe we're approaching a time of year when I can wait until *after* dinner to turn on my desk light. In the almost two months since my last newsletter, I've been doing a lot of [reading](/books), having 1:1s with some pretty rad people, [learning Rust](https://github.com/jackyzha0/rs-openai/), and of course surviving school. Surviving, in this case, is a questionable word choice.\n\n## 3 things I’ve found interesting\n\n1. [Multimodal Neurons in Neural Networks](https://openai.com/blog/multimodal-neurons/). First off, Spider-Man neuron. This paper is an interesting exploration on how neural networks can appear to have an understanding of abstract higher-level concepts that are *composable*. A lot of really interesting potential here.\n2. [Sounds of the Mandelbrot Set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiAj9WW1OfQ). Is mayonaisse an instrument? Yes, and fractals are too. A really cool look into doing an auditory visualization of things we wouldn't normally associate with sound.\n3. [Jazz Messages](https://jazzkeys.plan8.co/?msg=-MVYtMespmT9iNLyKnqO). Send notes to your friends in style with **j a z z**.\n\n## 2 things I’ve been wondering about\n\n1. What does it mean to find fulfilment in what you do? I've found myself involved with an overabundance of projects in the past year and only a select handful have truly been fulfilling to work on. I'm doing a bit of introspection in hopes of maybe figuring out why I love doing the things I love and maybe an answer to [`$whoami`](/thoughts/whoami).\n2. [What's not in the frame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRZuEGuU_es). In which Hank talks about the [metaphorical 'frame'](/posts/framing), or the context in which people present themselves. People choose to present themselves a certain way in front of others and in doing so, leave a lot of what's *actually* going on outside the frame. If all we ever see are other people's frames, how do we remind ourselves of what's going on outside of it and normalize being 'out-of-frame'?\n\n## 1 thing I’ve done\nPretty slow month in terms of personal projects/pieces, mostly either working on patching up older projects (finally got around to updating [Docker Explained](https://github.com/jackyzha0/docker-explained)). I did end up finishing Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software by Nadia Eghbal and found some really interesting ideas that I wanted to explore and flesh out a bit. I had a few convos with a friend on Twitter and ended up writing a piece on [why Open Source should be funded](posts/paid-open-source.md).\n\nStay tuned for next month(s) and don't forget to be awesome :)","title":"Spider-man neurons, hearing fractals, and fulfilment"},"/newsletters/issue-3":{"content":"---\ntitle: \"Sun sneezing, infrastructure moderation, and why bikes are better than tricycles\"\ndate: 2021-04-20T13:43:34-08:00\nissueNum: 3\n---\n\nHello there and welcome back to another issue of some mildly coherent ramblings. It's been yet another couple busy weeks, but I've just wrapped up my second decade on this crazy planet! I have a lot of really exciting life updates that I want to share with all of you soon, but without further ado: the content you subscribed for.\n\n## 3 things I’ve found interesting\n\n1. [Context Collapse](https://www.rewire.org/context-collapse-online/). Follow up to last issue's ['What's not in the frame'](/posts/framing) question, I was finally able to put a name to a concept I've had floating around! The TLDR is the experience when all your different personalities or frames from different contexts (e.g. work, friend group, family) all intermingle. In a place where so many of your social groups intersect, it becomes difficult to decide how to behave or 'be yourself'.\n2. [Emergent Behaviour and Cellular Automata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-iSQQgOd1A). Mesmerizing video by [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/user/Cercopithecan) on [how complex (and beautiful) behaviour can arise out of simple rules.](/thoughts/emergent-behaviour) I've been wanting to get into experimenting with shaders and graphics stuff and this *might* just be the slight nudge I needed.\n3. [Sun Sneezing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69XZJ9DEj0). When people ask me what I'm allergic to, my two answers are 1) pollen and 2) the sun. Yes, I sneeze when I look at the sun.\n\n## 2 things I’ve been wondering about\n\n1. [Moderation in Infrastructure](https://stratechery.com/2021/moderation-in-infrastructure/). I've been thinking a lot about [infrastructure](/thoughts/infrastructure). How do we draw the line between an end product and infrastructure? How should infrastructure regulate usage on its platform (if at all)? Been thinking about AWS's decision to remove Parler recently and whether it was warranted for AWS to do so. At what level of infrastructure should something become a '[public good](thoughts/public-goods.md)'? As more and more of our digital infrastructure is built out under private companies, does it change how we govern content on top of it?\n2. [Are 'easy-to-use' products always better?](https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/348/000/) Interesting read about the 'seductive, destructive appeal of ease of use': the belief that \"ease of use\" is somehow conflated with better products. I always hear that complex tools and apps being not implemented because user research proved that it was 'too difficult to use' but is this costing us in the long run? One great example the article talks about is the tricycle/bicycle analogy. \"It is clear that for an unskilled user, the tricycle is much easier to use. But, as we know, the payoff from investing in learning to ride on two wheels is enormous.\" Related: [building tools around workflows](thoughts/workflows.md)\n\n## 1 thing I’ve done\n\nI spent some time last weekend rewriting the frontend of [ctrl-v](http://ctrl-v.app/), my open-source Pastebin clone to use Next.js instead of React + React Router! Wrote up a blog post on my process here: [https://blog.jzhao.xyz/posts/ctrlv-next/](/posts/ctrlv-next). The weather has been nice in Vancouver the past couple of days so I've had the chance to just go outside and read in a park which has been a really nice change of pace from my usual go-go-go-get-shit-done daily schedule. Looking forward to finishing up this semester, I have a lot of really cool projects I want to work in the next month and a bit!\n\nUntil next time, don't forget to be awesome :)","title":"Sun sneezing, infrastructure moderation, and why bikes are better than tricycles"},"/newsletters/issue-4":{"content":"---\ntitle: \"The bookstore with a single book, knowledge distillation, and tight feedback loops\"\ndate: 2021-06-04T13:43:34-08:00\nissueNum: 4\n---\n\nI am writing this newsletter edition as NYC is being bombarded by hail. The sounds of little balls of ice ricocheting off of the roof has a sort of din to it that feels oddly comforting? In any case, your (bi) monthly dose of links from yours truly:\n\n## 3 things I’ve found interesting\n\n1. [The bookstore with a single book.](https://www.takram.com/projects/a-single-room-with-a-single-book-morioka-shoten/) This is a tiny bookstore in Tokyo that sells a single book at a time in a small room. I really love the emphasis on getting to know a single book and author intimately -- especially in an age of [digital consumerism](/thoughts/attention-economy).\n2. [Beware of tight feedback loops.](https://brianlui.dog/2020/05/10/beware-of-tight-feedback-loops/) I've always believed that rapid [feedback](/thoughts/feedback-loops) is always necessarily good. Yet, Brian warns about relying too much on these tight feedback loops -- feedback in life is almost always noisy. Only focusing on rapid feedback can lead one to ignore the larger scale trends.\n3. [Why Algorithmic Systems Create Absurd Outcomes](https://ali-alkhatib.com/papers/chi/utopia/utopia.pdf) (or if you prefer the [video version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KLAa62h1E0). Loved how accessible this paper/video was in explaining some pretty complex topics. I've often found myself having trouble putting into words why 'big tech' and monopolies in general are bad other than the generic \"we need competition for innovation\" excuse and this humanistic approach really resonated with me.\n\n## 2 things I’ve been wondering about\n\n1. [The role of knowledge distillation.](https://distill.pub/2017/research-debt/) After finishing *The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software*, I have been seeing parallels between software maintenance and systems of knowledge. So much emphasis nowadays is on creation rather than maintenance; it would be interesting to see if we can shift the emphasis from creation of new knowledge to maintenance of existing knowledge. I think there's lots of work that can be done to improve how we go about [distillation of knowledge](thoughts/knowledge-distillation.md) through teaching and giving children agency to explore ideas (more on this in *Mindstorms*).\n2. [The double bind of developing tech.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collingridge_dilemma) Still trying to wrap my head fully around this idea, but the main gist is that there are two opposing facts that seem to make developing tech ethically very difficult. The first is that it's hard to figure out what impact technology will make until *after* one develops and releases it to the public to use. The second is that regulating and/or changing technology is extremely difficult after the technology becomes entrenched within society. No thoughts on this yet, but just wondering if there's any way to get out of this [double-bind](/thoughts/catch22) (or at least productively avoid it).\n\n## 1 thing I’ve done\nLots of change in my personal life too! I finally worked up the courage to cut out a few commitments from my life in an effort to reclaim some time to just explore some ideas I have + enjoy life in NYC :') Reach out if you're around!","title":"The bookstore with a single book, knowledge distillation, and tight feedback loops"},"/newsletters/issue-5":{"content":"---\ntitle: \"5\"\ndate: 2021-06-08T11:13:01-04:00\nissueNum: 5\ndraft: true\n---\n\nIntro\n\n## 3 things I’ve found interesting\n\n1. \n2. \n3. \n\n## 2 things I’ve been wondering about\n\n1. \n2. \n\n## 1 thing I’ve done\n\n\nLinks:\n[pseudonymous-web](/thoughts/articles/pseudonymous-web)\n[cities-and-programming](/thoughts/articles/cities-and-programming)\n\n\nLong\nhttps://academicworks.cuny.edu/gc_pubs/490/\nhttps://direct.mit.edu/artl/article/27/1/44/101872/The-Impossibility-of-Automating-Ambiguity\nhttps://free-for.dev/#/?id=tools-for-teams-and-collaboration\nhttps://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v37/n18/amia-srinivasan/stop-the-robot-apocalypse\nhttps://automatter.substack.com/\n\nShort\nhttps://www.briantimar.com/notes/mimetic/mimetic/\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooko%27s_triangle\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault\nhttps://danluu.com/sounds-easy/\n\nhttp://www.jsadikkhan.com/streetfight-the-book.html\nhttps://kenliu.name/books/what-is-silkpunk/\nhttps://honk.me/\nhttps://slim.computer/visual-proofs/proof/\n\nhttps://danluu.com/p95-skill/\nhttps://psmag.com/news/all-wikipedia-roads-lead-to-philosophy-but-some-of-them-go-through-southeast-europe-first\n\nhttps://benjaminreinhardt.com/parpa-2-pager.pdf\n","title":"5"},"/notwork":{"content":"---\ntitle: \"Not work\"\n---\n\nContrary to popular belief, I actually have other things I do outside of writing questionable code and school!

You can find my more general thoughts in my [second brain and digital garden](/toc/directory).\n\n## Music + Podcasts\nAccording to my [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/notecho?si=9bKqHkhLQFenGqlXza2F2Q) wrapped, I spent 109,535 minutes listening to music and podcasts in the past year. Some of my favourite artists include Jeremy Zucker, Rex Orange County, HONNE, Daniel Caesar just to name a few. Ocassionaly, I'll bust out a musical or a movie soundtrack from the likes of In the Heights, Dear Evan Hansen, or La La Land. During long transits I can always count on [The Radical AI Podcast](https://www.radicalai.org/), [Philosiphize This!](https://www.philosophizethis.org/), and the [Lex Fridman Podcast](https://lexfridman.com/podcast/) to open the door to something new to learn about.\n\n## Arts 'n crafts\nWhen I'm feeling *really* adventerous, I'll try my hand at some watercolour or maybe a crochet project or two. Plus, they make nice presents :) I don't have any nice pictures to show you but you'll just have to trust me that they're at least half-presentable.\n","title":"Not work"},"/posts/2020":{"content":"---\ntitle: \"2020: An Imperfect Palindrome\"\ndate: 2020-12-30T13:43:34-08:00\n---\n\n## A year of 'almosts'\n2020 is:\n* about 9.5 times longer than a Rick Roll in seconds\n* about 54 times longer than the number of minutes I listened to Spotify this year\n* about how many contributions I made on GitHub this year\n* roughly the amount of pages I've read this year\n* almost a palindrome\n\nNow there's nothing super fascinating about almost-palindromes but it is also very fitting given the number of 'almosts' in my year. Here's an imperfect recollection of what I've been up to this year.\n\n### nwPlus\nI help to do event logistics at nwPlus! This year, Allison and Anne somehow convinced me to take on a director role for HackCamp (or what was previously known as UBC Local Hack Day). \n\nTo be completely frank, I had no clue what that really entailed and jumped into it head-first. Along the way, I struggled with figuring out how to effectively lead a team of 4 older teammates, balancing nwPlus with all my other commitments, and being confident in my work as director. We had a bunch of logistical wrenches thrown our way, from figuring out how to bring our hackathon to the virtual stage to an navigating an entire event rebrand. It was honestly amazing to have even been able to hold the event at all, let alone attract over 900+ registrations, 500+ attendees, 3.2k+ livestream viewers, and $1200 in donations to charities. To say I was completely blown away by the turnout would be a massive understatement. We didn't get to hold the in-person event we were hoping for, but the next-best thing was almost just as good.\n\n![Post-HackCamp feels](/posts/images/2020/post-hc.png)*Post-HackCamp Feels*\n\n### A poorly played game of Tetris\nDue to a combination of poor planning, luck, and FOMO, I made the poor decision to take on an internship at Hootsuite along with the open-source fellowship at MLH, all the while trying to juggle my mental sanity and health. Spoiler alert: it was a bad idea.\n\nMy calendar ended up looking a lot like a poorly played game of Tetris as I tried to stack hackathon onto after-work social onto tech talk. Unfortunately in this version of Tetris, there was no line clearing when I fully packed a week. You don't need more than two braincells to realize that a schedule like that just isn't sustainable. I was often working upwards of 80+ hours a week and I felt like death reincarnate. I think the lowest point of the summer was sitting on the couch after working an 8 hour day at Hootsuite followed by another 6 hours on fellowship things and realizing that I only had oatmeal in the morning. \"I should learn to play the ukelele.\"\n\nIn order to get through the summer, I had to develop healthier coping methods to deal with the stress, anxiety, and general lack-of-time-to-do-anything that came along with it. Though I by no means have claimed to have solved any of these things, I've found a few things to be really helpful in maintaining some semblance of mental sanity:\n\n1. **Time Blocking** -- COVID had eliminated any physical boundaries I already had; no 15 minute transit to separate work and home, no physical walk required to go from home to school. As a result, everything started to meld together. If it only takes me 3 clicks to go from my club meeting to my work tickets, I can just work just a little longer, right? I found that time blocking really let me regain a little bit of control back in my life. I could tell myself to only spend *x* hours doing *y*. It had the added benefit of allowing me to *actually block off time for myself* and to enjoy life a little bit.\n2. **Exercise** -- although I've known this fact for a while now, this is the year I've really decided to actually apply it to my life. Feeling like garbage? Go for a run to feel more like garbage for a good hour before feeling better! I've had the privilege of being really close to nature so I get to enjoy the subtle crunching of leaves and brisk autumn air with each step.\n3. **Quality time with quality people** -- 2020 was not a kind year to most, myself included and I'm not going to pretend otherwise. However, the presence of a select few individuals in my life really helped to make the year slightly less of a dumpster fire. You know who you are :')\n\n### Independent living\nI finally moved out from on-campus housing into my own place! I've definitely felt tinges of loneliness during the pandemic but I've learned to fill the silence with music, podcasts, reading, or questionable arts and crafts. I've also somehow managed to get by the past few months without giving myself food poisoning in my transition from campus food to homecooked food.\n\nNo fancy photos here but enjoy a few pictures of my workspace and the view from my balcony.\n\n![Home sweet 127.0.0.1](/posts/images/2020/home.png)*Home sweet 127.0.0.1*\n\n## An imperfect retrospective\nIt would be sort of naive to try to list out everything that went well/didn't go well this year. Too much happened this year to fully give each bit of my year the respect it deserves, so in the spirit of this 'almost' year, enjoy this 'almost' restrospective.\n\n### Things that sparked joy\n- **Surrounding myself with genuine people who care.**\n- **Picking up old hobbies and books** -- Heraclitus said, \"No man steps in the same river twice.\" The second time around, both man and river are different than they were before. The paints and books are the same, but we change between reads and brushstrokes. The world changes, too. I've found it really rewarding to be able to pick up old hobbies like watercolour, crocheting, and [reading](/thoughts/reading) and discover it for the second time.\n- **Exercising more and enjoying nature** -- not everday you get to read during sunset at the top of a peak with some of your closest friends.\n### Things that didn't spark to joy\n- **Learning to block out time better** -- although I did improve on this, I've definitely told myself \"ah, another few hours couldn't hurt\" far too many times this year. I need to work on prioritizing my time more and saying no to things.\n- **Balancing intake and output** -- How does one balance learning/intake of information intake with processing and thinking about that information? This year felt like trying to drink information through a firehose and spitting it right back out using a paper straw. I'm trying to work on better processes for choosing what information to explore more and to spend more time thinking and marinating thoughts.

I'm not setting these goals just to achieve some number, but rather to enjoy the act of doing it or to develop a habit. I had a conversation with [Emre](https://twitter.com/AlcaEmre) about this and he brought up Reversal Theory as a way to understand our motivations and goals. In particular, one of the four domains of Reversal Theory is the means-ends domain. Motivations in this domain lie somewhere on the telic to paratelic action scale.\n\n**Telic Actions** are more serious in nature, motivated by wanting to achieve something or reach a goal. This would be like writing an essay to get a good mark. Most telic actions are a means to an end rather than the actual end themselves.\n\n**Paratelic Actions** are more playful in nature and involve enjoying the process in the moment. This is more akin to reading for enjoyment and for the pleasure of learning. Hopefully, these are the actual end goals that telic actions will help achieve. With that in mind, here are my 2021 goals!\n### Paratelic Goals\n- Acknowledging my privilege and use it to help those who are less fortunate\n- Have impact with my work, whether that be through writing, projects, or just conversations\n- Lead a more physically healthy lifestyle\n- Learn more about the world through a feedback loop of reading, writing, and talking to people\n\n### Telic Goals\n- Donate 5% of pre-tax income to charity\n- Reach 50k people through projects and blog posts\n- Read 10 books\n- Set aside 10 hours a week for personal projects, learning, and writing\n- Be able to run from my apartment to Stanley Park and back (~10km) in one go\n- Have 1:1s with 50 new people in 2021\n\nI've been waiting almost 2 years to say this pun but,\n\n\u003e hindsight is 2020.\n\n(no I didn't plan on releasing this right at midnight, I just take a long time to write)","title":"2020: An Imperfect Palindrome"},"/posts/a-failure-resume":{"content":"---\ntitle: \"A Failure Resume\"\ndate: 2020-08-21T14:02:48-07:00\n---\n\nImposter Syndrome has been hitting really hard lately. Sometimes, it makes me feel like I don't deserve a lot of my current accomplishments and that I need to work even harder just to feel like I deserve what I have right now. I came across the concept of a **failure resume**[^1] a while ago. It's a list of things that didn't exactly go according to plan, and the lessons learned.\n\nThe more I think about it, the more I realize that a failure resume is a great way to document all the spectacular ways you've worked hard towards your own goals and accomplishments. In some ways, it validates your struggle and your effort.\n\nI've recently been inspired by both Kate Huang[^2] and Joice Tang's[^3] failure resumes and decided to make my own. What I wanted to try with this failure resume is, rather than focusing on the individual failures themselves, note what I learned from each of them. Hopefully, it'll serve as a powerful reminder to myself of how much I've struggled to get to where I am and why I deserve to be here. And more importantly, it serves as a place to reflect and learn from the past and be less scared of failure in the future.\n\n*A 2021 update:* Keeping a failure resume has let me be so much more ambitious in trying new things and applying for things I would otherwise think I'm unqualified to apply for! I'm really glad I started this.\n\nNow with all that stuff out of the way, here's the juicy list you've been waiting for:\n\n## 2021\n\n* Ghosted by both Contrary Build and Contrary Fellowship\n\n* Couldn't work up the courage to apply to the [Maintainers Summer Fellowship](https://themaintainers.org/summer-fellow)\n\t* I really love the work that the Maintainers org is doing and this internship would have combined so many things that I'm interested in and passionate about: maintenance, writing, software, infrastructure, etc. I just couldn't convince myself that I wouldn't have made a fool of myself by applying :(\n\n* Had to cut out a bunch of commitments in order to maintain mental sanity\n  * While this isn't a 'failure' in the traditional sense, it was a failure for me in terms of setting good boundaries for myself. I had been spending way too much of my 'free' time working for projects and commitments I wasn't 100% interested in. I missed being able to just dedicate an afternoon to tinkering and exploring an idea so I decided to make the leap and cut down on commitments. If it's not a hell yes, it's a no.\n\n* Rejected from the Delta Fellowship\n\n* Rejected from ZFellows after they reached out to 'learn more' about my idea\n  \n* Rejected from the Y. P. Heung Foundation Award\n  * This scholarship is awarded to someone who demonstrates outstanding academic performance and is involved with community activities. I thought that, despite my slightly-above-average grades, I had a decent shot at this award given my involvement with the CS community at UBC but things didn't turn out the way I wanted. This award would've helped alleviate the financial stress that comes with having to pay tuition out-of-pocket, so I'll need to work a bit more for that money.\n\n## 2020\n\n* Rejected from an undergraduate TA position for a CS course\n  * I really wanted to give TA-ing a shot, especially after hearing almost all friends' positive experiences with it, so I decided to apply to TA a class I had done well in. It was a good reality check to realize that there's more to being a TA than just good grades and the title. Next time I apply, I'll find a course that I'm really passionate about and get to know the prof better.\n\n* Didn't finish 3 of the projects I wanted to finish over the summer\n  * I think I really just tried to commit to too many things this summer and spread myself really thin \u0026mdash; I'm still working on learning how to say no!\n\n* Ghosted by a professor for an undergrad research position\n\n* Rejected from a lot of grants and incubator programs for reflect\n  * We took the shotgun approach by applying to as many grants as possible but ended up realizing that were just applying to grants for the sake of applying, rather than having a good reason for why. It was a really good catalyst to reflect (pun intended) on what we wanted reflect to be and what direction to take it in the future.\n\n* Rejected by DeepMind (and 67 of the 70 companies I applied to)\n  * This position rejection hurt more than most \u0026mdash; even if it was swift and abrupt. DeepMind is a company that has played a huge part in shaping my interest of the intersection of machine learning, ethics, and philosophy, so you can imagine that the rejection email was not a pleasant sight to see in my inbox.\n\n## 2019\n\n* Rejected by 46 of the 47 companies I applied to\n\n* Practiced data structures/algorithms for a few months only to completely blank on final round phone interviews\n  * Though I agree that the technical interview process is broken, I think there are still some lessons that can be learned. I suck at thinking under pressure so I'm going to learn to improve this by trying to keep my practice environment as similar to the real thing as possible. In this case, doing mock interviews with friends rather than just blindly grinding away at LeetCode.\n\n* Got a 52% on an honours math midterm\n  * It was an extremely difficult course but it really changed how I think about math and problem solving overall. I doubt I would've been able to learn those lessons in a regular math course. Even if the actual marks I got in the course were subpar at best, I think the lessons I learned were worth more than the GPA dent.\n\n* Rejected by Hack the North (despite being on their website ???)\n  * Sometimes even when all the cards seem to be in your favour, things just don't work out. There's a factor of luck in everything \u0026mdash; dont take things for granted!\n\n* Got charged an excess of $350CAD in cloud computing costs because of bad architectural decisions\n  * Ouch, this one really hurt the wallet. Learn to estimate costs in advance, and don't overengineer if you don't need to! Keep it to the simplest and most minimal viable product possible until you're ready to scale it. If it doesn't need huge infrastructure, don't design it that way!\n\n## 2018\n\n* Rejected by 16 of the 17 universities I applied to\n  * This was a good reality check \u0026mdash; the real world is difficult. Sometimes, what you offer may not be what the universities are looking for and thats ok! I think what matters more is what you do, not where you do it.\n\n* Rejected from a bunch of scholarships\n\n* Applied to speak at TEDxRedmond but got rejected at the last round\n  * I ended up learning a lot about my topic (ethics in AI and machine learning) through preparing for my speech. Even if I never got the chance to actually go up on stage and see it, the subject still ocassionally comes up in conversation and makes a great talking point! I think its super important to be educated on this, especially as our world becomes increasingly dominated by AI and machine learning.\n\n* Gave up on my DroneNet project after running out of money to work on it and little to no progress for multiple months\n  * This was my first **real** long term project and probably the project that got me really invested in the field of CS. I learned a lot about how to scope out and plan larger scale projects and how to stay motivated for long stretches of time.\n\n[^1]: [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/smarter-living/failure-resume.html)\n[^2]: [Kat Huang's](https://www.katmh.com/fail/)\n[^3]: [Joice Tang's](https://www.notion.so/failure-resume-5e67efb72dfe4f4896bc812ed94dc098)","title":"A Failure Resume"},"/posts/ai-systems":{"content":"---\ntitle: \"Machines and Intelligence\"\ndate: 2020-11-02T16:17:37-08:00\n---\n\nThis blog post is adapted from a term paper I wrote for PHIL250: Minds and Machines at UBC. I hope you enjoy the post and learn as much as I did in writing it!\n\n---\n\n## Introduction\nHistorically, development of AI has taken a very specific approach \u0026mdash; systems that represent the world through symbols and manipulate those tokens in a systematic way to arrive at a result. This type of AI was coined Good Old-Fashioned AI (GOFAI) by John Haugeland[^1]. \n\nThis worked well up until around 1984 when the field entered an 'AI Winter', a long plateau in progress that was most likely due cynicism in the AI research community that trickled to media and [funding](thoughts/funding.md) bodies, halting research and development[^2].\n\nHowever, with the rise of Moore's Law and the insane amount of compute and data available, a new approach to the development of AI arose \u0026mdash; one that focused on statistical methods and connectionist networks like artificial neural networks[^2]. Haugeland[^1] dubbed this approach to AI design New Fangled AI (NFAI).\n\nThis paper will examine factors that differentiate GOFAI and NFAI systems, such as their ability to adapt to changes in input, and the explainability of their outputs and internal representations. It will also examine current work in integrating the two approaches to Artificial Intelligence to create an artificial general intelligence.\n\n### GOFAI Systems\nSince the inception of the term GOFAI, the basic idea has remained unchanged: thinking as internal symbol manipulation. Within these GOFAI systems, symbols are representative of aspects of our world. These symbols are manipulated in a systematic and logical matter, performing a series of deterministic steps that results in another sequence of symbols[^1].\n\nA very common example of GOFAI systems are expert systems, which are computer systems that emulate the decision making ability of a human expert[^3]. They solve problems via decision-tree reasoning, figuring out whether to perform certain actions based off of if-then rules.\n\nHowever, just being able to solve a problem shouldn't be sufficient for intelligence. So what qualifies it? At its core, GOFAI can be considered 'artificially intelligent' because of semantic interpretation. If the symbols represent aspects of our world, the result, which is also a symbol sequence, can be *translated* back into aspects of our world. This is called semantic interpretation, which \"seeks to construe a body of symbols so that what they mean ('say') turns out to be consistently reasonable and sensible, given the situation\"[^1]. \n\n### NFAI Systems\nNFAI, on the other hand, is a diverse and still rapidly evolving set of systems and algorithms. It is more of a grab-bag term, roughly meaning any sort of scientific mind design that is not GOFAI[^1]. Under this umbrella are connectionist networks, which are networks composed of lots of simple units that are interconnected with various strengths. This paper will mostly focus on connectionism as a synecdoche for the greater umbrella of NFAI.\n\nSome classic examples of connectionist networks include convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are a form of image classifiers[^4]. These networks operate by applying filters or kernels to an input between layers of the network. Each of those filters have their own set of strengths that will learn and evolve over time to identify certain 'features' from the input. Similar to cell assemblies in animal perceptual systems, these filters assemble more complex patterns using smaller and simpler patterns[^5].\n\nThese connectionist networks are very inspired by the structure of the brain, with its hierarchical patterns and compositional nature[^6], rather than the rational manipulation of symbols that is observed in GOFAI.\n\n## The Potemkin Village Analogy\nWhile it is obvious that GOFAI and NFAI are very different approaches to constructing AI systems, how do they differ in their resilience to failure? An analogy that may be useful in visualizing this is a potemkin village \u0026mdash; a fake village that is built to resemble and deceive others into thinking it is real. AI systems attempt to build a sort of 'potemkin village' that \"works well on naturally occurring data, but is exposed as fake when one visits points in space that do not have high probability\"[^7].\n\nGOFAI systems are excellent at \"processing syntactical patterns like those characteristic of logical formulae, ordinary sentences, and many inferences\"[^1], but are also very narrow-minded and vulnerable when it comes to unexpected variations or oddities in the input given. The potemkin village that a GOFAI system may construct will hold up if only seen from the intended angles, but any slight deviation from an intended or expected input would shatter the illusion immediately.\n\nNFAI systems, on the other hand, are \"adept at finding various sort of similarities among patterns, at recognizing repeated (or almost repeated) patterns and filling in missing parts of incomplete patterns\"[^1]. These also happen to be the exact things that GOFAI systems struggle with. The potemkin village that a NFAI system may construct will hold up much more robustly to unexpected patterns or noisy input, but will, at heart, still be a fake village.\n\n## Rationality and explainability\nIn GOFAI systems, [intentionality](thoughts/intentionality.md) \u0026mdash; the meaning and semantics behind the tokens \u0026mdash; is injected through explicit programming by those who create it. These GOFAI systems are able to process these tokens and make conclusions based off of logic and reason rather than just trial-and-error. Case in point, expert systems. These if-then statements can easily explain decisions by showing which parts evaluated as true or false in its decision making process[^3]. \n\nConnectionist systems, for the most part, are very hard to explain and are often dubbed black-box models due to the hidden nature of its internal workings. Unlike GOFAI systems, its internal representation model is defined by the state of the entire network rather than that of any single unit \u0026mdash; this is commonly referred to as a distributed model of connectionist representation[^8] and is often claimed to be one of the distinctive features of connectionism.\n\n## Models of representation\nTo put it in sound terminology, note while in the GOFAI system, the *tokens* are the objects of formal processing, so the system which manipulates the tokens is the actual vehicle of computation. The tokens themselves are also *representations* of aspects of the world, so they are also vehicles of mental content. In GOFAI systems, tokens are both the vehicle of computation and the vehicle of mental content.\n\nThis is in contrast with connectionist systems, where computation is performed at the level of simple units (unit activations, backpropagation), meaning the units are the vehicles of computation. However, as these systems use a distributed model of representation, it is not a single unit that represents something, but rather the \"network state as a whole thats interpreted as representing\"[^8]. Thus, in connectionist systems, the vehicles of computation (units) need to be the vehicles of representation (network state).\n\n## Integrating GOFAI and NFAI\nGiven that GOFAI and NFAI systems seem so vastly different in their approaches to AI, how might one go about reconciling them?\n\nOne approach is to combine both into one system. This is used when there’s a rational, known, and algorithmic way to process a subproblem. Systems like AlphaZero, a connectionist based Go playing system, use mixed systems to achieve the level of performance they report. Although at heart, AlphaZero uses a deep neural network to assess new positions, it also uses a Monte Carlo Tree Search (a GOFAI algorithm) to determine its next move based of the assessment of the neural net[^9].\n\nAnother, less researched method, are interpretable connectionist systems. As traditional connectionist networks rely on the network state being the vehicle of representation, the complexity, depth, and scale of modern connectionist models means that it is becoming increasingly difficult for humans to interpret the output. The field of explainable AI (XAI) focuses on incentivizing connectionist networks to develop localist representations (i.e. moving away from having the vehicle of representation be at the network level, but at the unit level). Zhang, Wu, and Zhu of UCLA recently showed that it is possible to train a CNN to use 'interpretable filters', which encourage networks to group feature detectors into single filters, showing the possibility of moving from distributed representations to more local representations[^5].\n\n### What is AGI?\nWhile intelligence can be understood in many ways, this paper will focus on examining the prospects of emulating or achieving the capacity to understand or learn anything a human can \u0026mdash; the hallmark of an artificial general intelligence (AGI).\n\nMost commentators would agree that current AI systems fall short of implementing general intelligence[^4]. These are narrow AI systems, which are used to accomplish or solve specific tasks like the game of Go or language translation, rather than to attempt to create a system capable of AGI. So, what's stopping us from making the transition from domain-specific algorithms to domain-general algorithms?\n\nOne problem that stumped earlier attempts at AGI was the *common-sense problem*: how do we represent common-sense information that is obvious to most humans in a way that is accessible to AI systems that use natural language? Unsurprisingly, the problem of storing all of this information was solved by the massive explosion in compute and data in the past few decades[^2]. However, the difficult part of this problem, choosing what subset of that huge information bank is relevant in any situation, remains a huge unsolved problem. How do we update our database of knowledge when relationships between symbols change? This is referred to as the frame problem.\n\n### Dissolving the frame problem\nDreyfus[^10] posits that any AI systems which attempt to tackle the frame problem through storing relevant frames are bound to failure. He argues that, \"human beings do not simply store common-sense information,\" rather they \"directly perceive and act upon significance in their environment\". In his view, a more Heideggerian approach to AI will dissolve this problem.\n\nHeideggerian AI, in its most basic sense, is concerned with \nthe Heideggerian concept of Dasein, which literally means 'Being-there'[^11]. Through the use of this expression, Heidegger calls to attention the fact that a human cannot exist or be taken into account without existing in context of a world with other things \u0026mdash; \"to be human is to be fixed, embedded, and immersed in the physical, literal, tangible day to day world\"[^12].\n\nDreyfus believed that, for any AI system to achieve any sort of general intelligence, it must also exhibit Dasein. Thus, \"a successful Heideggerian AI would need a perfect model of the human body – and by implication, that Dasein must be expressed as a human being, organically as well as existentially\"[^10].\n\n### A non-humanistic approach\nHowever, Steed refutes Dreyfus' overly humanistic interpretation of Heideggerian AI, believing that a AI model only needs to be \"embedded and embodied such that what AI experiences is significant for AI in the particular way that AI is,\" and thus intelligence would be possible by Heideggerian standards[^13].\n\nThe refutation against a purely anthropocentric view of AI brings to light an important concept: the [multiple realization](/thoughts/multiple-realization) argument. Emulating or copying human intelligence isn't the only way to achieve intelligence that rivals that of humans.\n\nContemporary AI systems are almost always used as a problem solving tool, a means to tackle uniquely human problems and to convey results that are semantically useful to us. As a result, these approaches are doomed to be constrained by human problems. This is the essense of the [bitter lesson of AI](/thoughts/multiple-realization). However, if we look outside the anthropocentric view of intelligence, AI systems may not share these human problems with us and \"perhaps an authentic, free AI system does not converge to a solution that is interpretable from a human standpoint at all\"[^13]. \n\nAI is already capable of learning, adaptation, and basic Being-in-the-world. Thus, to achieve general intelligence, we should allow AI to contemplate its own problems and existence.\n\n[^1]: Huageland, John.

Say cheese!\n\nSee that? This is just one of many examples of where AI is becoming a larger part of what we accept as normal. What seemed far-fetched and straight out of science fiction a few years ago is now becoming a reality. \n\nToday, tech giants deploy AI to dictate what we see, hear, buy – even feel and think. They control what kind of news we see every morning, suggest places to go, and even drive our cars. In order for us to have a healthy relationship with this technology, we have to adapt as quickly as it is advancing. In doing so, we need to ask ourselves: what kind of decisions AI should be allowed to make?\n\n### What kind of decisions AI should be allowed to make?\n\nSure, most of you in the audience may be comfortable letting an AI decide what kind of music to add to your Spotify playlist, but when an AI needs to decide what kind of jail time a criminal should face we all get a little squeamish.\n\nIn fact, let me give you a few examples of decisions that AI make every single day and see whether you would be comfortable with an AI making that same decision.\n\n![An AI-based breast cancer detector in action](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BCz28oA5THs/W7_1x671dkI/AAAAAAAADXg/h6OcOZnRZl0vN8mw02gNVcwglJTqE87bwCLcBGAs/s1600/image1.png)*Google AI Blog, 2018*\nWould you be comfortable with an AI helping doctors to identify cancerous tumours?\n\n![A game of Survival of the Best Fit](/posts/images/bias-bug/hiring.png)*survivalofthebestfit.com*\nHow about an AI helping companies decide who to hire based on only your name, age, gender, and resume?\n\n![Chihuahua or muffin?](https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2016_10/1008761/chihuahua-muffin-today-160311-tease-02_15277fe1b7a8c911f94700f866189fc2.social_share_1024x512_center.jpg)*@teenybiscuit*\nThe classic image detection example: are these chihuahuas or muffins?\n\n![A modified version of the trolley problem](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*dCk2Jns5Deg4Y2O6KBcuzA.jpeg)*Illustration: Simon Landrein*\nHow about the trolley problem? Should a self-driving car \u0026mdash; given no other option \u0026mdash; kill A) the child or B) the elderly person?\n\nAs you can see, there is a really obvious difference each of those decisions that were proposed. In the tumour example and chihuahua example, you likely weren't super bothered if an AI were to make that decision. Yet for the hiring example and the self-driving car example, you likely were more uncertain.\n\n### Why the uncertainty?\n\nWhat we can see from this is that there is a difference between objective and subjective problems. In the tumour and chihuahua examples, we were mostly comfortable with that decision being made because there is a clear ‘right’ or ‘wrong.’ However, in the case of the hiring example and self-driving car example, the subjectivity makes it difficult. A lot of it has to do with what kind of environment we were raised in and how each of us sees the world. Everyone is born with some kind of bias, favouring certain ways of viewing the world.\n\nAI can do a lot of really great things such as helping doctors identify tumours or interpret the world for the deaf. But when used improperly, that subjectivity can propel some of the worst biases we have as humans.\n\n## Garbage in, garbage out\n\nThere’s a timeless saying “garbage in, garbage out” in the field of Computer Science which essentially states that bad data or bad input will produce an output that’s of equal quality. This holds true for almost all the tech we use today, from trading algorithms to search results. If what we put into the system is inherently unclear or flawed, then the output will also give back something that’s ‘wrong’ or doesn’t align with our objectives.\n\nHowever, this saying “garbage in, garbage out” is most prevalent in the AI which sits at the forefront of this tech revolution. AI, in one form or another, is still created by humans, who are imperfect, make mistakes, and are inherently biased.\n\nInterestingly, there are two distinct ways that this bias can shine through.\n\n### 1. Problem definition\n   \nThe first is in the problem definition. When creating an AI, we need to define an objective for it. That means putting something vague like “create a realistic human-sounding voice” or “help me translate this speech to French” into definitive, and certain terms and mathematical concepts. How do we do that? Because we don’t have algorithms that do this step for us, this is usually done by a team of machine learning engineers. They are responsible for deciding how to represent our ‘objective’ in terms of penalties and rewards. This also means that how the team of engineers decide to represent the problem is a product of their biases. \n\nTake Amazon for example. In 2014, Amazon decided to create a recruitment engine that was able to look at a job applicant and rate them from a one-star rating to a five-star rating. However, by 2015, Amazon realized that their software was not evaluating candidates for positions related to tech in a gender-neutral way[^4]. Although unintentionally, Amazon’s engineers included a gender field. The algorithm, after sifting through 10 years worth of resumes, began to favour men and penalize women. After deeper inspection, this was most likely an unfortunate reflection of the male-dominated tech industry. The lesson is clear. The algorithm served to reflect this bias that was observed in the past.\n\n### 2. Lack of Data Diversity \nThe second, less obvious way bias can poison AI is with data diversity \u0026mdash; or rather the lack of it. I think the best way to explain this is through a metaphor. Imagine the AI as a small child. It likes to learn from its environment. If this child were to be raised in a racist family, it will almost undoubtedly hold similar views in the future. This is a very similar case for AI. It learns from the environment and data it's given.\n\nOne case of this is the very first iteration of Google Photo’s image classification feature back in 2015. This feature claimed to be able to identify people, places, and things with high accuracy. Twitter user [@jackyalcine](https://twitter.com/jackyalcine/) found that the algorithm identified people with darker skin as gorillas[^3]. Google quickly was able to work and manually ‘patch’ the issue, but the actual issue was much deeper – and it had to do with the data used. In this case, the dataset that Google used to train their algorithm had an over proportional amount of middle-aged Caucasian people under the category of ‘people.’ This meant that while the recognition accuracy was really high for that select group of people, the accuracy for people of colour was significantly worse. \n\nFrom both cases, we can see that an over-focus on results and accuracy can cause these companies to ignore these biases. When the deadline is too tight or the manager sets an expectation for a “10% increase in accuracy,” there is a very strong incentive to ignore the ‘edge cases’ or things that happen very rarely.\n\nToo often our society is focused on the raw accuracy that we forget that the same accuracy metric is something that we set for ourselves – created arbitrarily by humans which have bias. Unfortunately, this results in things like the Google Photos and Amazon Hiring cases.\n\n## Fairness in AI\nTruth is, data lacks context. While the trends in the data may show that in the past there have been more men in the women in the workforce, the majority of the population can agree that we are moving away from that more traditional view into more of an equal playing ground. Unfortunately, these models that we create don’t have a deeper understanding of these changes and as a result, produces naïve predictions that we believe are wrong or ‘garbage.’ But is it really? Is it really only a ‘bad’ result because of what we define as fair or right?\n\n![COMPAS exhibiting bias against those of African descent](https://static.propublica.org/projects/algorithmic-bias/assets/img/generated/methodology-risk-of-recidivism-scores-by-race-900*363-482d1c.png)*ProPublica, 2016*\n\nWe can take a look at the COMPAS system which is a piece of software used by U.S. courts to assess the likelihood of a criminal to reoffend. ProPublica, a non-profit newsroom, did an investigation back in 2016[^1] and claimed that COMPAS was biased against those of African descent \u0026mdash; citing that it overestimated the false positive rate of reoffending for those of African descent by almost twice as high as those for Caucasians. ProPublica reasoned that a fair algorithm would not have such a big difference.\n\n### So, is COMPAS fair?\nWell, there’s no concrete answer.  The algorithm never had any access to any contextual information about the neighbourhoods or the actual situation for each of the offenses. Was the area more heavily policed because it was a predominantly black neighbourhood? Were the officers themselves biased in making arrests?\n\nEven more interestingly, a study done at Dartmouth[^2] showed that random volunteers, when given the same information as the COMPAS algorithm, achieved a nearly identical accuracy of identifying the rate of recidivism.\n\nThis is interesting. This means that either COMPAS is accurate or holds the exact same biases as we do as a society. Unfortunately, this is a problem that I don’t think we can solve, so we don’t have a solid definition as to what makes an algorithm fair. But what is clear, is that there is bias in play here, whether that be through the police, the companies, the actual algorithm, or society itself. This bias is what causes that “subjectivity” and “garbage in.” This is what is preventing us from making ‘fairer’ AI and applying AI to more tasks.\n\n### The inevitability of bias\nThe point is, unless we work to prevent, catch, and deter bias, it will inevitably occur. One of the biggest problems in the field of AI is that so many of the models exist in a black box, meaning that its inner workings are only known by a select few. This makes it near impossible to identify and train out bias. Machine intelligence will become almost integral to our lives, becoming less visible in the process, and AI’s bias bug will get harder to beat. Our time to act is now.\n\n## What we can do\n\u003e So? What can we, as the next generation, do to help?\n\nFirst, we need to build a [better understanding](thoughts/explainability.md) of how the AI systems we are building work. Through this understanding, we can better trust and, as a result, effectively manage the emerging generation of AI. So, don’t be afraid to learn that programming language you heard about. Read up on how that cool translation algorithm works. \n\nSecondly, we need to diversify. Diversify not only in the sense of having better representation in datasets, but in tech. Next time you pitch a new product, or create a new project, ask yourself this:\n\n\u003e “How many people have you considered before you make that decision?”\n\nLet's [design for everyone](/thoughts/books/design-justice). Consider people of different ethnic groups, sexualities, income, just to name a few. By having more representation in these teams, AI can cater to more than just that select group of people who are western, educated, and rich. Instead, by bringing in a fresh perspective on the problems that these teams are trying to tackle, they can create innovation that benefits a whole range of communities. \n\nWith increased diversity and representation, the Google Photo misidentification problem never would have happened. Together, we can help to build a future where diversity is no longer an issue in both machine learning models and tech, but society too. Where we don’t just use AI mindlessly but understand it and use it in such a way that it helps to empower humanity. Where we can work towards a future where we can begin to trust the more subjective decisions that an AI can make.\n\nTogether, we can make that future a reality tomorrow.

Its approach to weaving together insights from a vast number of disciplines to create something novel is extremely refreshing. I just read a section on learning, the knowledge illusion, and collaborative thinking and wanted to share some of my thoughts that have been bouncing around and marinating for a few days as well as some learnings that I've applied to my own life.\n\n## Collaborative Thinking\n\u003e Humans rarely think for themselves. Rather, we think in groups. Just as it takes a tribe to raise a child, it also takes a tribe to invent a tool, solve a conflict, or cure a disease. No individual knows everything it takes to build a cathedral, an atom bomb, or an aircraft. \n\nIt is no secret that the key to the rise of *Homo Sapiens* and the anthropocene wasn't due to the rationality of any individual human, but rather our collective unparalleled ability to think and share knowledge in large groups. This concept has arisen in the form of *specialization of labour*.\n\nAs a society, we consistently rely on the knowledge of others to live our own comfortable lives. I may not know how to grow my very own russet potatoes, but a farmer in Alberta might. Similarly, a plumber in Massachusetts may not know how to build their own website, but I might. Through being able to supplement each other's knowledge of the world, our *collective* knowledge is much greater.\n\n![Left: Collective knowledge of the group. Right: My subset of knowledge](/posts/images/collaborative-thinking/knowledge.png)*Left: Collective knowledge of the group. Right: My subset of knowledge*\n\nI like to think about collective knowledge as a big blob. Each individual contributes a unique *subset* of knowledge. We get the entirety of human knowledge by taking the *union of the knowledge* of all the individuals in the group. Of course, as these groups of individuals grow ever larger due to globalization, each individual may choose to specialize in a narrower subset of knowledge as generations go on to reduce redundancy. Why know how to build your own car when you can buy it yourself? The adoption of globally accepted currencies has made this easier than ever.\n\n## Knowledge illusion\nHumans also have this 'knowledge illusion' where we think we know a lot, even though individually we know very little. We treat the knowledge of the human collective as if it were our own, even subconsciously.\n\n![A crude illustration of a jacket zipper](/posts/images/collaborative-thinking/zipper.png)*A crude illustration of a jacket zipper*\n\nAn example Harari used was the sweater zipper. If I were to ask you if you knew how a zipper works, the vast majority of you would exclaim \"yes, of course!\" Yet, if asked to describe in *detail* every single step, most would fail to do so. Even with something that seems so basic and intuitive seems to elude an explicit explanation. We have begun to stand on the shoulders of giants yet refuse to acknowledge their presence.\n\nAlthough we may have increased the overall area of our collective knowledge, the surface area of each individual has also shrunken, turning from balanced and broad to narrow and unwieldy.\n\n## Rebalancing our blob of knowledge\nAnother interesting property about the knowledge blobs of individuals is that they are *magnetic*. I mean this in the sense that individuals that have one blob of knowledge tend to attract and be attracted to individuals with similar orientations and shapes in their blobs of knowledge, much like how magnetic dipoles align in a magnet. As humans, we tend to want to minimize our cognitive dissonance and surrounding ourselves with like-minded individuals is the easiest way to do that.\n\nIndividuals in these clusters experience a sort of echo chamber effect whereby the *magnitude* of their knowledge is amplified through the mutual alignment of their knowledge. However, this also poses a unique challenge where movement only happens in one direction and there is little to no room to deviate from that direction and try something new; something incredibly dangerous for innovation. This, in a sense, is turning collaborative thinking into groupthink.\n\n\u003e People afraid of losing their truth tend to be more violent than people who are used to looking at the world from several different viewpoints.\n\n![Broadening our base fundamental knowledge. Blue: Previous 'specialized' knowledge. Purple: broad foundational knowledge](/posts/images/collaborative-thinking/spikes.png)*Blue: Previous 'specialized' knowledge. Purple: broad foundational knowledge*\n\nWhat we can do to counteract this extreme alignment is to build a broader foundation of knowledge. When you come across an individual with differing views, hopefully you will at least have the base fundamental knowledge to understand their perspective.\n\n## Learning communities\nThis, at least in part, is why I've recently become more certain of wanting to go to [academia](/thoughts/academia) in the future. I used to have tunnel-vision in thinking that all I wanted to do in the future was to just work in industry CS. Recently, I've started to realize that CS not a single discipline, but rather it's a tool that can help solve uniquely human problems, and these human problems are inherently multidisciplinary.\n\nI've started to read and learn more about the world around me outside of my little bubble of CS-related topics and it's been eye-opening to see issues I read about in my philosophy class come up in a linguistics lecture which in turn comes up in a book I'm reading. I've found that the best way for me to cement my learning and understanding is through discussion with people, rather than just sitting and ruminating on my own -- a very different pace than the typical *code-Stackoverflow-copy-repeat* self-learning cycle that most programmers (including myself) are familiar with.\n\nThe important part of learning communities like colleges is not necessarily the alignment in what you're studying, but rather in the shared mindset of discussion, learning, and understanding. To broaden my foundation of knowledge is to read more about the opinions and findings of others and to critically discuss these among peers who may have different views. If we want our specialized knowledge to be applicable in a wide range of situations, we need a broad foundational base that can support that.\n\n## Wiggle room\n\u003e If you want to go deeply into any subject, you need a lot of time, and in particular, you need the privilege of wasting time. You need to experiment with unproductive paths, explore dead ends, make space for doubts and boredom, and allow little seeds of insight to slowly grow and blossom\n\nFor me, learning is very close to a zero-sum game. I can only expand the area of my knowledge blob so fast. If I want to broaden my foundational knowledge base, I need to reign in the amount of time spent growing purely technical strengths and to stop saying 'yes' to any and every opportunity that comes up.\n\nSlowly but surely, I'm learning to value my own time and to set it aside to just absorb more about the world and to extend the reaches of my knowledge just a little bit further. To dilly-dally among the Wikipedia rabbit holes, cultivate [my digital garden](/posts/digital-gardening), and faff among the ridiculously long list of side projects I planned to start. I'm experimenting with what I previously thought were deadends and little seeds of insight are starting to grow. Maybe I'll find something interesting to share among the construction of this broader foundation.\n\n**Acknowledgements**\n\nA big thank yu to [Anson](https://twitter.com/ansonyuu) for always being a sounding board for fresh dough (half-baked ideas would be too generous of a description for these).

I wanted to see what all the fuss was about, so I finally set aside some time this weekend to rewrite the frontend using Next.js and deployed it on Vercel instead of Firebase Hosting. I thought it would take the whole weekend, but I managed to go from zero knowledge about Next.js to a fully finished refactor in just under 6 hours!\n\nThis will be more of a technical blog post walking through my process in converting ctrl-v from using React Router and Firebase Hosting to Next.js and Firebase.\n\nSource code: https://github.com/jackyzha0/ctrl-v\n\n## Learning Next.js\nI'm a very hands-on learner. I learn the fastest stumbling my way through a project with a framework I barely know my way around than watching multiple video examples or reading blog posts. Having a tangible project to work with and break as I learned things really helped speed up the learning process for me. That being said, here are a few other resources I found really helpful in my journey!  \n\n* [Next.js in 100 seconds + good beginner tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sklc_fQBmcs)\n* [Twiddling around with `create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app)\n* [Next.js official documentation for migrating from React Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/migrating/from-react-router)\n\n## Why Next.js\nThe main reason I wanted to switch to Next.js is because it makes it dead easy to implement both Static Site Generation (SSG) and Server Side Rendering (SSR) for your React app. For those uninitiated, SSR and SSG are different approaches to rendering content.\n\nIn **Client Side Rendering (CSR)**, the client is responsible for rendering the content on the page. All they receive is an empty HTML document, and a bunch of JavaScript bundles through which the browser populates the page. The downside of this approach is that no content exists on the page when it is first loaded. As a result, web crawlers won't be able to find your content (not great for SEO), and you won't get link previews to your content as the page metadata won't have loaded. This is the behaviour you get when you use plain old React.\n\nIn **Server Side Rendering (SSR)**, the server is responsible for rendering the content of the page and sending the fully rendered the content to the user to display. In this approach, all the content is already loaded when the user is receives it, we only need JavaScript to make it interactable (i.e. hydrate it). As a result, this approach is a lot more SEO friendly.\n\nOn the very other end of the spectrum, **Static Site Generation (SSG)**, means that the server does all of the page rendering at *build time* rather than on each request. This has all the same benefits as SSR but doesn't really make a lot of sense for this project as I don't have a full list of pages I need to render handy.\n\n**A hybrid approach**\n\nHowever, Next.js doesn't force you to choose between the two. It actually prides itself in just how easy they make it to switch between them. Here's the approach I decided to take for ctrl-v. \n\nIn the old frontend, everything was completely client-side rendered. My 'productionized' application was quite literally an `index.html` with a bunch of JS bundles. It sucked as whenever I sent a ctrl-v link to a friend, there wouldn't be a preview about what the content was and most people were scared to just open a random link like that (rightfully so). There was also a not-very-pleasant 'loading paste...' period before any content actually appeared on the screen.\n\n![Old vs new approaches to rendering content](/posts/images/ctrlv-next/rendering.png)\n\nI realized that there were only really two main types of pages\n1. View Paste (`/:paste`)\n2. Create Paste (`/`)\n\nNothing on the create paste page actually required hitting the backend, it was effectively completely static. I could safely just replace that entire page and have it be statically generated at build time. The view paste page required me to make a call to ctrl-v's backend API but I still wanted the page to have that content rendered on server so I opted for client side rendering on any view paste pages.\n\n## Steps\n### Replacing React Router with `next/router`\nNext.js uses a file-based routing system rather than routes-as-code approach that React Router takes. I decided to first convert the new paste page as that would be completely SSG. Luckily, I had originally structured my React components into a `pages` folder so pulling out that component into a page wasn't terrible.\n\nI wasn't super certain of how SSR worked right off the bat so I first played with the `/raw/:paste` page first before tackling the comparatively more scary `/:paste` page with password handling and actual error handling. \n\n```jsx\n// old CSR\nconst Raw = ({hash}) =\u003e {\n   const { err, result } = useFetchPaste(hash)\n   return \u003cRawText\u003e{result?.content || err}\u003c/RawText\u003e\n}\n\nexport default Raw\n\n// new SSR\nexport async function getServerSideProps(ctx) {\n  // ctx.params.hash allows us to access the slug (the :paste part of the url)\n  const data = await resolvePaste(ctx.params.hash)\n  return { props: { ...data } }\n}\n\nconst Raw = ({error, data}) =\u003e {\n  return \u003cdiv\u003e\n    {/* Only load title/description metadata if no error */}\n    {!error \u0026\u0026 \u003cNextHead data={data} /\u003e}\n    \u003cRawText\u003e\n      {/* Just render the content if it exists, otherwise render the errror */}\n      {data?.content || error}\n    \u003c/RawText\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n}\n\nexport default Raw\n```\n\nThe biggest part I needed to wrap my head around was the `getServerSideProps` async function. I didn't realize that the only job that `getServerSideProps` actually does, is fetch data and pass that data as props to your actual component. Once that clicked, the rest of the refactoring went relatively smoothly.\n\nI had to refactor my `useFetchPaste` hook to just fetch data and then delegated the responsibility of state and password validation shenanigans to whatever component. I ended up changing the name to `resolvePaste` as it no longer followed the [Rules of Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html).\n\nIn hindsight, I probably should've done this step incrementally using something like [Next.js's rewrite rules](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/rewrites) to gradually transition ctrl-v from React Router to Next.js. Luckily I didn't have that many pages to migrate but this is good to know for the future.\n\n### `styled-components` and theme provider\nFrom what I've seen, Next.js doesn't play nicely with `styled-components` out of the box. Throughout the entire previous step, I was looking at painfully broken CSS. Turns out you need to [install an additional Babel plugin](https://styled-components.com/docs/tooling#babel-plugin) to add SSR support to `styled-components`. Then, I added a custom `Document` to `pages/_document.js`. This code augments the root `\u003chtml\u003e` tag of our application which will allow us to inline our CSS styles. \n\n```jsx\n// shamelessly stolen from\n// https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/master/examples/with-styled-components/pages/_document.js\nimport Document from 'next/document'\nimport { ServerStyleSheet } from 'styled-components'\n\nexport default class StyledDocument extends Document {\n  static async getInitialProps(ctx) {\n    const sheet = new ServerStyleSheet()\n    const originalRenderPage = ctx.renderPage\n\n    try {\n      ctx.renderPage = () =\u003e\n        originalRenderPage({\n          enhanceApp: (App) =\u003e (props) =\u003e\n            sheet.collectStyles(\u003cApp {...props} /\u003e),\n        })\n\n      const initialProps = await Document.getInitialProps(ctx)\n      return {\n        ...initialProps,\n        styles: (\n          \u003cdiv\u003e\n            {initialProps.styles}\n            {sheet.getStyleElement()}\n          \u003c/div\u003e\n        ),\n      }\n    } finally {\n      sheet.seal()\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAs I was also using theme provider from `styled-components`, I needed a way to wrap the ThemeProvider component around everything. Luckily a custom `App` created by adding a `pages/_app.js` will allow us to do just that. This also allows us to add any 'global' structure like padding or margins around the edges.\n\n```jsx\nimport ThemeProvider from \"../theme/ThemeProvider\";\nimport GlobalStyle from \"../theme/GlobalStyle\";\n\nconst Main = styled.div`\n  margin-top: 10vh;\n  padding: 0 20vw 30px 20vw;\n`\n\nconst App = ({ Component, pageProps }) =\u003e (\n  \u003cThemeProvider\u003e\n    \u003cGlobalStyle /\u003e\n    \u003cHead\u003e\n      \u003ctitle\u003ectrl-v | a modern, open-source pastebin\u003c/title\u003e\n    \u003c/Head\u003e\n    \u003cMain id=\"appElement\"\u003e\n      \u003cComponent {...pageProps} /\u003e\n    \u003c/Main\u003e\n  \u003c/ThemeProvider\u003e\n)\n\nexport default App\n```\n\n\n### State caching for password pastes\nThis part stumped me for a good bit. I needed to find a way to do an initial data fetch, check to see if the paste has a password, prompt the user for a password, then reload the page data. I contemplated using [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) for data fetching but realized in the shower that it wouldn't really make sense as the initial load is handled in the `getServerSideProps` function anyways. I realized the best way forward was to fetch the initial state in `getServerSideProps` then store it as a React State so I can update it when a password is entered and data is re-fetched. This way there are no page reloads to disrupt user experience and keeps code change minimal. \n\n```jsx\n// simplified version of pages/[hash].js\nexport async function getServerSideProps(ctx) {\n  const data = await resolvePaste(ctx.params.hash)\n  return { props: { ...data } }\n}\n\nconst ViewPaste = ({data, unauthorized, error}) =\u003e {\n  const router = useRouter()\n  const { hash } = router.query // equivalent to ctx.params.hash\n  const [enteredPass, setEnteredPass] = useState('');\n  const [correctPass, setCorrectPass] = useState(!unauthorized);\n  const [clientData, setClientData] = useState(data)\n  const {content, language, expiry, title} = clientData;\n\n  const getWithPassword = (password, errorCallback) =\u003e {\n    resolvePaste(hash, password)\n      .then(resp =\u003e {\n        setCorrectPass(true)\n        setClientData(resp.data)\n      })\n      .catch(e =\u003e errorCallback(e.response.data))\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\n      {!error \u0026\u0026 \u003cNextHead data={data} /\u003e}\n      ...\n      \u003cPasteInfo\n        hash={hash}\n        lang={language}\n        theme={theme}\n        expiry={expiry}\n        err={unauthorized ? '' : error}\n      /\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  );\n}\n\nexport default ViewPaste\n```\n\n### Deployment\nGreat! At this point, everything was working great -- locally. Every developer knows just how much of a leap it is to go from local machine to hosted and on the cloud. Right?\n\nMy first thought was to see how difficult it would be to port my existing frontend on Firebase Hosting to run using Next.js instead. Turns out I would've needed to enable Firebase Functions and to do that I needed to enable the Blaze plan (pay as you go). Seeing just [how much of a hassle the process was](https://dev.to/rowaxl/what-i-struggled-with-next-js-using-firebase-hosting-and-enable-ssr-4e67) made me look for other alternatives. \n\nVercel really surprised me with how easy it was to get setup. All I had to do was signup for Vercel using my GitHub account and select a repository to import. It took a total of 5 minutes to go from GitHub repo to deployed website which was a first.\n\nFunnily enough, the hardest part of this entire deployment process was deleting the old frontend off of Firebase. I accidentally deleted the entire project (including my Cloud Run deployed backend) twice and quite nearly misconfigured my domain.\n\n## Impact\nAll in all, trading 6 hours for such a huge quality-of-life improvement on a project that I personally use a lot has been absolutely worth it. To list a few tangible improvements:\n\n* Smoother user experience (no more annoying 'loading paste...' messages)\n* Cleaner codebase\n* Better link previews (sending links to friends)\n  \nIf you haven't had the chance to try Next.js out for yourself and you've made it this far, you owe it to yourself to at least give it a shot. Thanks to the HackClub community (specifically [Rishi](https://rishi.cx/), [Safin](https://safin.dev/), and [Ani](https://anirudhb.github.io/)) for their constant encouragement and criticism of my 'outdated' tech stack.\n\n**Source Code**: https://github.com/jackyzha0/ctrl-v\n\n**Try it out for yourself**: https://ctrl-v.app/","title":"Rewriting ctrl-v using Next.js"},"/posts/digital-gardening":{"content":"---\ntitle: \"Digital Gardening\"\ndate: 2021-01-30T16:53:01-08:00\n---\n\n\u003e As of 2021, this process is no longer accurate. I've embraced a much more networked form of note taking which I've written about [here](posts/networked-thought.md).\n\nThe first image that comes to my head when I hear the word 'gardening' is of a small plot with some leafy greens sprouting their heads from an earthy bed. A gardener tenderly shovels and removes unwanted weeds and pours water to nourish the plants he wants to grow. He takes care to make sure the soil isn't too wet and that each plant has ample space to grow. When the time comes, he harvests each fruit and vegetable and makes sure to plant seeds so that he can repeat the process anew in a few weeks time.\n\nA garden is a metaphor for a lot of things: growth, persistence, and the constant battle against entropy.\n\nWhen I talk about digital gardening, I don't mean digital gardening in the Stardew Valley or FarmVille sense. I mean gardening as in the tending and growth of my own ideas and projects on my own little plot of the world wide web -- namely through my writing, notes, and projects. After reading Joel Hook's blog post on his own [digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden), I've been thinking and reflecting on my own processes for managing [my own digital garden](/toc/directory).\n\n## The garden plot\nAccording to [GitHub](https://github.com/jackyzha0/blog/commit/74f7460c49a7c56acfadf3f8f1cdd892005ebed4), I first created this blog in late August of [2020](posts/2020.md). At the time, it was more of a novelty thing. I wanted to get off of Medium and onto my own platform where I had more fine-grained control over how I could present my work and how people discover it.\n\nI spent a few hours building out my own Hugo theme, making it as frictionless as possible to write produce new content. I threw up a few of my old Medium blog posts just to see how it would look, and I was happy with it. However, even with the novelty of the blog, I had nothing to write about.\n\nThe plot was there; I just didn't have anything to plant in it.\n\n![The Garden Plot](/posts/images/digital-gardening/plot.png)\n\n## Planting the seeds\n\nIf you have no seeds in your garden, the only things that will grow are weeds. I could barely remember the last time I read a book on my own time. Needless to say, garbage in, garbage out.\n\nOver the summer, I began to read again. Technical write-ups, fiction novels, traversing into self-help, and memoirs. I started to read more about the state of the world and critically discuss these with family and friends. Reading helped me colour in the lines as to why we need to build in the first place. I started to realize that the problems we try so hard to solve with technology are not actually tech problems, but inherently human ones.\n\nI've started to write more about some these ideas (like within this blog post!), at first to help me organize my own thoughts, but eventually segued into an excuse for me to talk to people about interesting ideas and get their perspective. It's started a sort of chain reaction, with observations from a book leading to a conversation with a friend to a blog post ad infinitum. I've been able to slowly build up my [base of knowledge](/posts/collaborative-thinking/) so that I can contribute meaningfully to conversations.\n\nThese are the seeds I plant in my garden, but these seeds will stay seeds unless watered.\n\n![Planting the seeds](/posts/images/digital-gardening/seeds.png)\n\n## Watering the plants\n\nI have a Notion page of random thoughts and ideas. Whenever I come across something interesting in a conversation or book or article, I file it away in this Notion page. Slowly, categories have appeared as blog posts, articles, and papers coalesce and self-organize.\n\nThis input of information -- the water -- is what allows the ideas to grow. Just as it's not enough to just water a plant once and forget about it, I've found that in-taking information inconsistently is about as good as not doing it at all. To be an effective watering can, I need to be intentional and consistent with my watering.\n\nMy process of collecting random scraps of information first sprung up from coming across interesting blog posts on Reddit. I'd always just read a cool post, follow a few hyperlinks, nod to myself and say \"huh\", and maybe forward it to a friend or two. While it may have been entertaining to read, I got no value out of it. Now that I've started cultivating this garden of ideas, I have a reason to be more intentional in how I sift through the information and be more mindful of what I'm actually taking away from each piece. Writing, specifically on this blog and on my newsletter (which you can subscribe to at the bottom of this page), has helped me to go back to more mature ideas and condense and refine them into something presentable and legible to others -- quite literally picking the fruit of my labour. \n\n\u003e We are all constantly bombarded with information, a lot of it is really good information too, but the challenge is absorbing it and applying it to the context of our lives and careers. \u0026mdash; Joel Hooks\n\nNow that I have all of these new-found ideas and tidbits of information, what do I do with them? Keep growing them forever? At some point on the [exploit-explore](/thoughts/exploit-explore) tradeoff, this knowledge should be applied to something in order to manifest it into something useful. The problem is, which ideas get priority of my time and effort?\n\n![Watering the plants](/posts/images/digital-gardening/watering.png)\n\n## Pulling weeds\n\nNo garden has unlimited space or nutrition to go around. Maybe you have a bigger garden than most, but that doesn't mean you can grow whatever you want silly-willy. Some will need more space than others and others you simply just cannot grow in the same garden plot.\n\nSimilarly, no one has unlimited time and energy they can put into projects and learning. I, unfortunately, have yet to fully learn this lesson. After having an empty plot for so long, having a little greenery show up has inspired me into a planting frenzy, trying to cram as much into the garden as possible.\n\nI'm starting to step back and reflect on my current commitments and deciding to either to step down from things that I'm less passionate about to make more time and room to double down on the things I'm truly passionate about.\n\n![Pulling weeds](/posts/images/digital-gardening/weeds.png)\n\n## End\n\nNone of what I do is perfect. Looking back at writing from a year ago, reading code from a few months ago even, makes me cringe a little. Like any garden, this one evolves and grows over time; there is no 'end-state' that I'm trying to get the garden to. This little garden is just a little place for me to experiment, to push out things that I'm working on, and to provide snapshots of all the in-progress things going on in my life.\n\nThrough tending to this garden [in public](/thoughts/building-in-public), I hope to show my success, failures, and everything in between and offer it as an open garden to learn from for anyone who stumbles upon it in the future. If just one person is inspired by it, learns from a mistake I made, or builds off of my work, then I would consider this garden a success.\n\nMaybe you'll find this as an incentive to start your own.","title":"Digital Gardening"},"/posts/docker":{"content":"---\ntitle: \"Docker Explained\"\ndate: 2020-07-22T00:14:11-07:00\n---\n\nContent from my own ['Docker Explained' repo](https://github.com/jackyzha0/docker-explained). Check out the repository for example code!\n\n## Introduction\n### What is Docker?\nDocker is a tool that makes it really easy to package applications into self-sustaining 'containers'.\n\n### What are containers?\nContainers, as their name suggests, contain things. In the case of Docker, these contain all the parts the application needs to run, everything from libraries and dependencies to the actual source code.\n\n### Why containers?\nContainerization means that everything to do with your application stays inside the container. You shouldn't need to worry about how stuff on your machine (e.g. which version of Python you have) affects how your program runs. As a side benefit, this means that Docker containers are dependency-free. Never worry about \"oh, it works on my machine\" ever again! After a Docker image is created, all of its contents are frozen so it should work exactly the same on your computer as it does for someone else (assuming you both have Docker).\n\n### Why Docker?\nDocker makes it super easy to work with these containers and, by proxy, you can get all the cool benefits of containers easily too! It also allows you to programmatically define a container through code, meaning you can collaborate and work on Docker containers just as you would with a regular piece of code through version control like `git`.\n\n## Installing Docker\nMore detailed instructions can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).\n\n## Parts of Docker\n### Docker Containers\nI think the intro covered this pretty well so I'll repeat it again here.\n\n\u003e Containers, as their name suggests, contain things. In the case of Docker, these contain all the parts the application needs to run, everything from libraries and dependencies to the actual source code.\n\nThis means that 'containerized' applications don't need to rely on a system to have certain dependencies (e.g. `Node.js`) installed on the user's system to run because the container will have it packaged.\n\nYou can think of Docker containers like a fully self-contained and running version of your application.\n\n### Docker Image\nYou can think of Docker images like a sort of 'template' that describes to Docker how to create a container from scratch. You can build these images by providing instructions on how to build them in the form of layers.\n\n### Layers\nDocker images, like ogres (or cakes if you're a boring person), have many layers. The base layer often provides some basic functionality like providing `git`, `bash` or `apt` -- otherwise your container has nothing to run off of! We can then add our own layers on top of that base layer, like installing dependencies, copying files into the image, and defining the command to run when the container starts up. These instructions are programmatically defined through a Dockerfile.\n\n\u003e One of the coolest parts of Docker is that these layers get cached between builds if nothing has changed. That means that if you rebuild an image and only changed the last layer, it'll only need to rebuild the last layer rather than rebuilding the whole image, making for some really fast iteration times.\n\n### Dockerfile\nThe Dockerfile are the actual specific instructions for how to create the actual image or 'template'. The Dockerfile starts off by defining a 'base-layer', which serve as the basis for your actual image. Some common base layers are `ubuntu` (which contains a minimal install of the actual Ubuntu operating system) and `python` (which contains everything needed to run a basic Python app). \n\nI won't dive into too much details about each command you can use as these will be described more in-depth within the examples. You can find detailed documentation on the commands you can use in a Dockerfile here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/\n\n## Docker CLI\nGreat, so now I know a little bit about how Docker actually works, how do I get started? First, let's make sure our Docker install works correctly. You can do this by opening your favourite terminal and entering `docker run hello-world`. You should get something that looks like:\n\n```bash\n$ docker run hello-world\n\nHello from Docker.\nThis message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.\n...\n```\n\nNow, let's go over a few basic CLI commands that you'll probably be using as you work with Docker.\n\n### `docker build`\n\u003e How do I turn a Dockerfile into an actual image? \n\nTo built an image, you can do `docker build . -t \u003cname-of-image\u003e` which tells Docker to look in the current directory for a file called `Dockerfile` and to follow the instructions inside to build an image. After doing so, tag the image so we can easily find it later. Docker image tags let you version your images as well. Say you wanted to build a v1 for your image, you would do `docker build . -t \u003cname-of-image\u003e:v1`. If you have a different name for your Dockerfile, you can also refer to it using the `-f` flag like so: `docker build . -t \u003cname-of-image\u003e -f \u003cname-of-dockerfile\u003e`\n\nMore info can be found here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/\n\n### `docker image ls`\n\u003e How do I get a list of all the images I've built?\n\nThe command will give you an output that looks something like the following.\n\n```bash\nREPOSITORY                 TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE\nimage1                     0.1.1               9eb95c7f06b0        2 days ago          343MB\nimage2                     \u003cnone\u003e              c99ac06cf60a        2 days ago           23MB\n...\n```\n\nMore info can be found here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/image_ls/\n\n### `docker run`\n\u003e How do I create a container from an image?\n\nNow that you've built an image, you can just run it by doing `docker run \u003cname-of-container\u003e:\u003cversion\u003e`. More often than not, you can just use the latest version of the image, `docker run \u003cname-of-container\u003e:latest`. However, certain applications (like servers) need to listen on specific ports. By default, Docker doesn't allow containers to use ports on your local machine, but you can allow this by specifying ports using the `-p` flag, `docker run -p \u003chost-port\u003e:\u003ccontainer-port\u003e \u003cname-of-container\u003e`. If your container listens on port 3000, but you want it to appear as port 5000 on your local machine, it would look like `docker run -p 5000:3000 \u003cname-of-container\u003e`\n\nIf you want to run your container in the background in a detached manner, you can just add the `-d` flag.\n\nMore info can be found here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/\n\n### `docker ps`\n\u003e How do I figure out what containers are currently running?\n\nYou can get a list of currently running containers by doing `docker ps`, which will give you each container running along with details about its Container ID, what image it was created from, when it was created, as well as which ports are open.\n\n### `docker exec`\n\u003e How do I run a command inside a container?\n\nYou can use the command `docker exec -it \u003ccontainer name\u003e /bin/bash` to get a bash shell in the container, allowing you to run commands from within the container as if it was a full-fledged machine. If you know specifically what command you want to execute, you can use `docker exec -it \u003ccontainer name\u003e \u003ccommand\u003e` to execute whatever command you specify in the container.\n\n## Docker Examples\n1.

What's all the hype about? Basically, its the [single responsibility principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle) but applied to services. This means that each responsibility should, ideally, be split out into its own service and be completely responsible for that one thing. This lends itself really easily to Docker and containers. Kubernetes is a system that makes it really easy to deploy, scale, and manage a bunch of containers, making it near ideal in creating a microservices architecture using Docker.\n* https://microservices.io/\n* https://medium.com/hashmapinc/the-what-why-and-how-of-a-microservices-architecture-4179579423a9\n* https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/\n* https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/\n* https://opensource.com/article/17/11/getting-started-kubernetes\n\n## Deploying to the Cloud\nNow that you got some cool new containers? How do I run them in the Cloud like all the other cool kids? Thankfully, Docker makes this super easy too.\n\n### Google Cloud Run (GCR)\n\u003e https://cloud.google.com/run\n\nGCR completely manages scaling and deploying your containers for you so you don't need to worry about server management (yay serverless)! Simply upload your images to Google Container Registry, and create a new Cloud Run deployment.\n\n* https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/quickstarts/prebuilt-deploy\n* https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/quickstarts/build-and-deploy\n\n### Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)\n\u003e https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine\n\nWant to run your own Kubernetes cluster and have a lot of money to burn? GKE may be right for you! Other than the price, GKE is super user friendly and makes it really easy to manage and visualize your deployments.\n\n### Amazon Fargate\n\u003e https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/\n\nThink GCR but Bezos.\n\n* https://medium.com/@ariklevliber/aws-fargate-from-start-to-finish-for-a-nodejs-app-9a0e5fbf6361\n\n# Closing\nI hope you learned a thing or two about Docker!

I also wouldn't post LinkedIn-style business content to my Facebook timeline. To an extent, my social presence across these platforms is *incongruent*. The core tenet is that different apps curate different types of communities and thus social contexts. As a result, we try to separate these contexts in the best way we know how to: by acting differently, **and that's ok.** \n\nIt is not 'inconsistent' for us to want to frame ourselves differently on Twitter than on Facebook, and in fact, a lot of key aspects of human behaviour point to why we default to doing so.\n\nThe problem comes when these spaces start bleeding into each other, and the boundaries between the different audiences on each of them start amalgamating. The *overlap* in target audience between these spaces then becomes very large and all of these different social contexts ['collapse'](https://www.rewire.org/context-collapse-online/) and it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain these separate personalities.\n\n## What's (not) in the frame\nIn this [vlogbrothers video from March](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRZuEGuU_es), John Green talks about the metaphorical frame in which people present themselves. We tailor and adjust our behaviour depending on the environment we're in, or the audience we find ourselves in front of. However, in doing so, we inadvertently portray an incomplete picture – we frame only the parts we want them to see.\n\n\u003e \"I mean of course the central trick of the social internet, is that whenever you make something, you choose what's inside the frame, but as viewers the rest of us can't help but believe what's inside the frame, because it's literally all we can see\"\n\nAn unfortunate side effect of this is that it starts setting expectations for the audience as to how we 'normally' behave. This 'audience' of people can be friends, followers, or strangers. They are a group of people that pay attention to what *you* have to say because of your thoughts, opinions, and general persona. So what happens when we change?\n\nIf we're expected to keep growing as people, these thoughts and opinions will obviously change over time. So why does it feel so *weird*, for both the audience and ourselves, to deviate from these set identities that we've become used to portraying in certain scenarios?\n\n## Context separation\n![Abstract illustration of a blob framed by two picture frames](/posts/images/framing/context-separation.png)\n\nIn order to answer that question, let us make a brief foray into the realm of psychology. Why do humans tend to act differently in different environments? I think three key aspects of behaviour play a role here:\n\n### People are unique\nNo one individual has the exact same interests, goals, values, and identity as you. We have different friends and environments, so we create different contexts in which we can exercise different aspects of ourselves. People find spaces where they can authentically express all the dimensions of themselves. If a situation only exercises one axis of our self-identity, we will actively seek out places to exercise other axes.\n\n### Behaviour is sticky\nIt is easier to travel along a path well-travelled than one covered in weeds and bush -- if you do something once, it becomes easier to do it again. Similarly, doing something with a certain context once means it becomes easier to repeat that same behaviour in that context again. If I use Twitter as my social media of choice to post memes, I'm likely to continue using it like so.\n\nIn some ways, this is Newton's First Law but applied to behaviour: if you do something one way, you are likely to keep doing things in that way unless encouraged to do otherwise.\n\n### Individuals tend to conform to group norms\nIn 1951, Solomon Asch conducted [an experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments) to investigate the extent of which social pressures can affect a person's behaviour. In this experiment, he asked, \"Which line is the longest out of the three given?\". In an individual setting, 99% of people answered correctly. However, when put in a room of actors instructed to answer incorrectly, nearly 75% of all participants gave at least one incorrect answer throughout 12 trials.\n\nPeople conform for two main reasons:\n1. They want to fit in with the [group](/thoughts/communities) **(normative influence)**\n2. They believe the group is better informed than they are **(informational influence)**\n\nHistorically, having different behaviours in different contexts may have been evolutionarily beneficial, helping us to better collaborate and form connections with each other without causing undue conflict.\n\nEven as children, when we get hurt, we look to authority figures around us to see how to react. If our mother comes to us expressing worry and concern, we cry. If everyone around us continues to play as if everything is normal, we will brush aside the injury and continue to play with the group.\n\nOur ability to 'frame' ourselves different depending on the social situation likely stemmed from this behaviour too.\n\n\n## Why context collapse is bad\n![Abstract illustration of a blob framed by two picture frames](/posts/images/framing/context-collapse.png)\n\nWhen experiencing context collapse, talking to your audience beyond a surface level becomes very difficult. Smaller groups, by nature, have more commonalities to relate to, whether that be interests, music taste, place of study, or lived experiences. These groups provide the chance for individuals to have intimate conversations and exercise different facets of themselves that they otherwise wouldn't get the chance to. A queer person may be out to a close group of friends but not to their family; a budding writer can have a safe place to explore potential ideas without alienating the rest of their friend group.\n\nWhen we experience context collapse, these social groups and audiences become massive, and the amount of overlap in interests or values of the collective group is miniscule. How are you supposed to have any sort of meaningful connection when the only thing you share in common on the platform is that you ‘know’ each other?\n\n## Centrifuging contexts\nI’ve noticed three main strategies individuals, companies, and platforms have adopted in trying to tackle context collapse.\n\n1. **Lowest Common Denominator**. Only making posts that anybody will be able to understand and relate to, staying away from controversial or overly personal topics. This approach places an emphasis on quantity of impressions over quality of impressions.\n\n2. **Realtime**. Platforms and individuals are leaning more towards [ephemereal content](/thoughts/ephemereal-content), like stories or streaming. The 'live' aspect of it means that the audience is encouraged to interact immediately, creating a tighter feedback loop with the audience.\n\n3. **Fragmentation**. Purposefully having conversations in places where your audience is smaller, like group chats, direct messages, or small closed communities. In these cases, the specific context and audience is well-defined. More users are also turning to 'finstas' which are accounts focused for a closed group of friends and family rather than the entire public internet.\n\nI don’t think there is a single 'right' approach, and in part that's why so many types of social networks exist today: they each have their own merits that incentive different approaches to communication. But one part I do want to emphasize is the tradeoff of depth and breadth in these approaches.\n\n## Social bandwidth\nI think in part, this is why nobody has been successful in creating a single social network to replace all of the existing apps. As humans, we want the ability to closely connect with people, and context collapses makes that exceedingly difficult. We have limited social bandwidth -- there's only so much attention we can give to everyone. By increasing the breadth of our audience, we reduce the depth at which we can communicate with each individual. As app developers rush to combine all of these platforms into one, maybe we should step back and think whether this is really necessary.\n\nOn these larger social media apps where I'm 'connected' to hundreds of people, I don't feel like I can have very insightful conversations or thoughts. Those conversations almost exclusively happen in communities like [nwPlus](http://nwplus.io/) and [reboot](https://twitter.com/reboot_hq/) where there is enough alignment of values and interests that we can scrape past the surface level chit chat and get to really exploring ideas and knowing people.\n\nBecause we're so actively a part of all of these different contexts, we are forced to be excessively general on these platforms to try to cater to everyone. We should have platforms where it's ok to engage with different elements of who you are. We have different groups of friends to cater to different aspects of who we are, so why should social media platforms be any different?\n\nDifferent social contexts call for different social behaviours, and that's ok.\n\n*Special thanks to Anson, Ivan, Rishi, Joss, Jasmine, Kat, and Anh for helping read over and edit this piece!

Wake up -- the drone is **flying**!\"\n\nHalf of our team had been sleeping for the past hour and a bit. Acceptable, considering the time was now 2:42 am. The drone was whirring midair in our little room, nearly getting snagged on our laptops, chargers, and free event swag. Beside us, a blackboard wall displayed a rough chalk diagram of our technical architecture. We had roughly 20 hours left in the hackathon and now that the drone worked, our biggest roadblock was out of the way — it was time to build! We grabbed a plate of cold noodles from the meal line and ran past the crowd of people doing cup stacking competitions, karaoke, and Smash tournaments.\n\nThere is something truly special about being able to manifest an idea into reality, that's what pulled me into hackathons in the first place. Anytime I went to a hackathon not knowing anyone, I left with a new group of friends and mentors and a handful of new skills. I've learned a sizable amount of my technical knowledge through workshops and hackathon projects. These events inspired me to be intellectually curious. To this day, they're the main reason why I still to this day spend hours tinkering on projects and exploring new ideas.\n\nIn comparison, something feels different about the vast majority of hackathons held today. Recent hackathons may have all the bells and whistles of earlier events, featuring elaborate meal plans and free bubble tea, but it feels performative at best. When asking most people about why they want to go to a hackathon, most people will mention something about the prizes, the recruiting, or the free t-shirts with company logos plastered over them. There is an unavoidable corporate air to the events.\n\nHowever, this transition goes much further back than just the past few years. The origin of the more 'modern,' corporate hackathons arose out of corporate spaces like Facebook, which coopted design spaces like hackathons to further their hiring pipelines or to maintain their outward appearance being 'cool' to work for.[^1]\n\nThis corporate co-optation of hacker culture at hackathons has been on the back of my mind ever since reading the chapter on design sites in [*Design Justice*](/thoughts/books/design-justice) by Sasha Costanza-Chock. As someone who first got their footing in computer science through hackathons, it pains me to see that this is the rep that hackathons have slowly gotten over time, moving from safe spaces for idea exploration to increasingly corporate, competitive events where hackers spin up apps to test company products in exchange for the slim chance of winning prizes and recognition.\n\nHow did we get here?\n\n## Hacker Culture\nThe hacker subculture formed mainly out of the collaborative (and often competitive) DIY ethic of the [counterculture](/thoughts/books/fctc) of the 1960s. This was the generation of the 'hackers,' those interested in figuring things out as they go and invented for the *pure ecstasy of building and learning new things*. As Steven Levy defines it, 'hacks' were projects undertaken by these hackers not to fulfill any sort of end goal other than to take pleasure from working on it.[^2]\n\nThe congregation of hackers eventually led to the creation of alternative design and hackerspaces like hackathons. These very first hackathons were gatherings of excited groups of people ready to build something cool over the weekend.\n\nThese spaces were described as originally being \"third spaces\" outside of the influence of the state and the capitalist market.[^3] Yet, without intentional intervention, it is difficult for these design spaces to even uphold their claim as spaces for intellectual exploration for all, as they become dominated mostly by the privileged to expend free time and income, and overrun by corporations clamouring to sponsor hackathons in order to get as much cheap testing on their products as possible, shoving discount code after free credits at each hacker.\n\n**These design sites used to be valorized as places of learning, making, and building. Why then, have they become increasingly corporate places of extraction of free labour?**\n\n## Incentive Structure of Hackathons\n![Stacks of hackathon stickers ready for hackers' laptops](/posts/images/hackathons/swag.jpg)*Stacks of hackathon stickers ready for hackers' laptops*\n\nIt takes money to run events. Providing an adequate venue, food, internet, and power are not free resources. Yet, with the exception of a few corporate hackathons, the majority of hackathons remain free for attendees. To accomplish this, most hackathon organizers decide to try to acquire monetary sponsorships, food partnerships, and in-kind sponsorships in order to offset costs.\n\nAs a result a viscious cycle forms:\n1. Sponsors try to maximize the benefits they get for their money (e.g. hosting workshops, hiring booths, keynote speakers, company branding)\n2. With more money, hackathon organizers increase the size and scope of the event, leading to more hackers\n3. Hackers see sponsors as increasingly quintessential to the hackathon experience, being a key reason why hackers attend the events (sponsor prizes, free merch, hiring opportunities, etc.)\n4. Repeat\n\nThis leads to some key downstream effects on hackathon culture.\n\n### Prize Incentives\n\u003e \"People are now prioritizing their projects for the dollar value of prizes and the clout of awards. There is a trend where more and more attendees no longer come in to learn and make memories. Teams are now arriving to hackathons fully formed, with an idea in hand, and a checklist of the prizes they want to win.\" -- [Jonathon Xu](https://jonathanxu.com/blog/2020-07-25-on-hackathons)\n\nIncreasingly so, hackathons have placed more emphasis on prizes rather than building. They prominently display the total value of prizes available to entice hackers to attend, tout the available prizes again at opening ceremonies, and repeatedly blast announcements on them during hacking hours. Even DevPost, the 'homepage' for hackathons, organizes hackathons by how much there is to reap. Then again, who wouldn't want a free iPad and tens of thousands in cash prizes and online subscriptions?\n\n![DevPost Top Hackathon categories by prize pool](/posts/images/hackathons/devpost.png)*DevPost Top Hackathon categories by prize pool*\n\nUnfortunately, this incentive structure attracts people to hackathons for the wrong reasons. Individuals are motivated to tick boxes on a judging rubric rather than to learn and build new skills on a solid foundation; people who *are* there to learn are pushed to try and compete for prizes instead. Beginners, who may have wanted to just learn how to build a website, are instead cajoled into unsustainably trying to learn how to build something completely out of their skill range, becoming frustrated and losing sleep in the process. This is not to say that pushing hackers outside of their comfort range is a bad thing, but there is a limit to how much useful knowledge is retained after patching together APIs and blindly copying tutorials.\n\nThese incentive structures push hackers to tailor projects specifically for prizes to see just how many sponsor prizes they can shotgun for. In most of these cases, hackers don't dare build outside of their comfort zone, instead choosing to work with technology they are already familiar with or project ideas they know have been successful in the past (don't say you haven't seen a gamifying volunteering or smart garbage bin hack before).\n\n### Short Term Optimization\n\u003e \"A one day hack for homelessness takes away from the complexity of social justice issues… you can't just come up with an app that solve the world's problems\" -- Design Justice[^3]\n\nMost hackathon projects are unsustainable and are unlikely to be used or continued to be worked on outside of the hackathon. A lot of this practice arises out of the Silicon Valley [saviorism problem](https://www.stanforddaily.com/2018/02/16/silicon-valleys-saviorism-problem/) and \"move fast and break things\" attitude. [^7] \n\nThe problem with this approach is that it becomes incredibly reductionist. Hacks nearly always focus on problems and rarely build on existing knowledge and work in the field, often ignoring important context about the issues they so readily reduce to a single web app. Ever seen an app claiming to solve the fentanyl crisis or healthcare for the elderly? People think hackathons can do things that they usually can't, such as solve global problems, create new products overnight, or 'level the playing field' of innovation through meritocracy.[^3]\n\nHackathons, as they stand today, seem to optimize for short term excitement, and not so much for long term benefit. But this short-term burst of new products and ideas is exactly what corporations need to fuel their endless hunger for products, testing, and new talent.\n\n## Corporate Cooptation\n\n![Cupstacking, a commonplace hackathon activity](/posts/images/hackathons/cooptation.jpg)*Cupstacking, a commonplace hackathon activity*\n\nCompanies realized that the attendees of these design spaces would *readily* give up their free time to build potentially marketable products. If hackers so readily built things in their own time, why couldn't we co opt these for the company? Hackers provided a source of interesting ideas that could be milked, and, as a result, the creative outputs of these hackerspaces were \"suddenly highly acclaimed, applied, and copy-pasted into capitalist developing laboratories.\"[^5]\n\nThe free market has warped the hacker ethos and hackerspaces into something almost unrecognizable from what it was supposed to stand for. This set of values which may have worked well for small startups or individuals just doesn't scale well for an entire industry. Sharon Zukin and Max Papadantonakis in their work *Hackathons as Co-optation Ritual* describe three quasi-Orwellian principles that describe this new hacker culture: Work is Play, Exhaustion is Effervescent, and Precarity is Opportunity.[^1]\n\n### Work is Play\n\u003e \"Forget about work-life balance. It's all about work-life _integration._ Why else would the office have on-site acupuncture, nap pods, and free dinner after 7 pm?\" -- [Arielle Pardes, WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/how-silicon-valley-ruined-work-culture)\n\nThe initial hacker ethos of wanting to 'innovate' was evident in how vehemently startups disowned the 9-to-5 cubicle life. Walk into any tech company office building and you'd barely be able to tell if it was supposed to be a corporate office or adult playground with all the ping pong tables and colourful decor. The expectation was for employees to treat coworkers as family, office as home, and work as play.\n\nBut this playful front is not exactly as it seems. A [2017 study](https://businessresearcher.sagepub.com/sbr-1863-102641-2779724/20170508/more-companies-offering-unlimited-time-off) by Sage Business Researcher found that employees who work in offices with these benefits tend to stay in the office longer after work, pushing individuals to spend more and more of their lives in the office. Corporations frame events like hackathons as fun events to attend in an effort to appeal to the hacker ethos and to maintain their public image of 'coolness'. Disguised under the nerf gun fights, ping pong tables, and free food is a more sinister intent to treat work as play. Is it wrong to love what you do and treat it as play? No, but corporations shouldn't conflate the hacker ethos with a willingness to 'play' at work.\n\n### Exhaustion is Effervescent\n\u003e \"There are way easier places to work, but nobody ever changed the world on 40 hours a week\" -- [Elon Musk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1067173497909141504)\n\n100 hour work weeks and 'hustle culture' are becoming increasingly normalized by tech moguls like Elon Musk. Being constantly tired is somewhat of a [status icon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_o7qjN3KF8U) as individuals boast about how little sleep they got.\n\nIt has been disturbingly normalized and even celebrated that exhaustion is a sign of strength. Among a [global sleep-loss pandemic](https://www.theguardian.com/business-to-business/2017/dec/04/clocking-off-the-companies-introducing-nap-time-to-the-workplace), events like hackathons which push for attendees to stay up for lengths of 24 to 36 hours are particularly worrisome.\n\nI am viscerally reminded of sharing a hard gym floor with dozens of other sleep-deprived hackers, taking shifts to sleep so some people can stay up to work on the hack. Despite the timeboxed nature of hackathons, there is no reason purposefully staying up all night should be quintessential to the hackathon experience.\n\nPhysical and mental health should not be \"instrumentalized in service of being useful to a startup mission, or even a life philosophy.\"[^7] These events set the precedence of what the next generation of engineers, builders, and designers consider as 'normal' for the industry. Why are we saying that it's okay to prioritize 'success' above personal wellbeing?\n\n### Precarity is Opportunity\nThe startup and hustle culture heavily idolizes those who live precarious lifestyles. *High risk, high reward*. The industry has normalized high turnover rates and job-hopping, with companies like Google and Amazon reporting median tenures of around a year, compared to the national average of 4.1 years.[^6]\n\nToday, the majority of tech employment consists of internships, contract work, short tenures at medium to large companies, and precarious work at startups. Because of the incredulous demand for tech jobs, candidates have considerably more leverage than employers do in offer negotiations, with individuals often using competing offers between companies to renege better signing bonuses and compensation.\n\nWhile not precarious in the traditional labour sense, the employment itself is unstable and temporary. The concept of a 'life-long job' just doesn't exist in this industry. As a result, individuals are constantly asked to market themselves for continually shifting jobs.\n\nSimilarly, these coopted design spaces reshape precarious and unpaid work from exploitative to opportunity. Writing code and building apps for free becomes something to be clamoured and competed over. In other words, \"institutions use the allure of hackathons, with sponsors, prizes, snacks, and potential for career advancement, to get people to work for free.\"[^4]\n\n## Reclaiming Design Spaces\n\n![Liminal spaces: The morning after nwHacks 2020](/posts/images/hackathons/liminal_space.jpg)*Liminal spaces: The morning after nwHacks 2020*\n\nMaybe this is the [death of the hackathon](https://jonathanxu.com/blog/2020-07-25-on-hackathons) as we know it, and that might not necessarily be a bad thing. Maybe we can throw away the focus on prizes, winning, and short-term projects and replace it with something better.\n\n### Sustainable Learning\n\u003e The word hackathon is the portmanteau of *hacking marathon*. Why then, do we treat it like a sprint?\n\nThe 'finish a complete project in two days' mindset of hackathons rarely transfers well into the real world. Realistically, most projects are complex in scope and attempting to reduce complex problems down to a one-weekend hack omits a lot of context and nuance that is often important.\n\nWork done at hackathons should be toward long-term sustainable processes instead of short term precarious work. During the past year, there has been a noticeable uptick in design spaces intended to facilitate longer term work like coliving houses, incubators, and fellowships. Hacker houses like [Edyfi](http://edyfi.org/) and [School 2.0](https://school2point0.com/) give individuals the option to work on existing projects or scale new ones in a supportive community. A few organizations like the Cal Hacks Foundation are pioneering initiatives in this space with programs like the [Cal Hacks Fellowship](https://fellowship.calhacks.io/) (a semester-long idea accelerator that invites teams to build beyond their side-projects) and [Hack Month](https://hackmonth.calhacks.io/) (which is a month-long build-a-thon focused on recentering the fun of building). MLH is also working on non-hackathon initiatives like the [MLH Fellowship](https://fellowship.mlh.io/) and the [Local Hack Day](https://localhackday.mlh.io/) workshops that refocus learning and maintenance rather than just blind creation. I've even noticed more individuals starting larger-scale personal projects that happen on the order of weeks to months rather than single days.\n\nEncouraging the growth of more sustainable skill building enables individuals to take into account a more holistic view of problems. Hopefully, this leads to building longer term, larger scope, and bigger impact projects and skills.\n\n### Places of Play\nDo we so necessarily need to tie rituals of play in building and tinkering to the recruiting and product testing pipeline for large corporations? Hopefully the answer to that question is no.\n\nYet even today, a majority of communities focused around building like [YCombinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/) or [OnDeck](https://www.beondeck.com/) are ultimately not places of play – they have external outcomes they'd like to achieve. We should create dedicated spaces for exploration and learning *without* needing to justify it via some specific outcome. This is not to say that spaces with those goals in mind are bad, but giving individuals the option to have a space for unfettered exploration can give them the freedom to explore ideas that may not have clear monetary value in the short term. Communities like [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/) and [Reboot](https://reboothq.substack.com/) do this particularly well. There is no central 'goal' of trying to launch a product or anything, but rather it's a group of individuals that are intellectually curious and want to learn and build cool things.\n\nThe goal is to provide the infrastructure so that *everyone* can play, not just those privileged enough to throw spare income and time at it. Hackathon organizers shouldn't assume that everyone is able and willing to stay up the entire event and barely set aside enough time for meals. It is important to consider food, bio breaks, accessible bathrooms that are friendly to all body types and genders, comfortable spaces to nap or relax, and decent lighting, etc.[^3]\n\n## Moving Forward\n![A project demo at nwHacks 2020](/posts/images/hackathons/reclaiming.jpg)*A project demo at nwHacks 2020*\n\nIf well-organized, hackathons can provide a fertile ground for pathways to employment as well as being a place of exploration. Those identities don't need to be mutually exclusive. My argument here is that hackathons have recently placed too much emphasis on the pathways to employment; the main focus of design spaces like hackathons should be on hackers, not sponsors. Even for lower-income students, the 'employment' opportunities are usually short-term and precarious. Of course, sponsorship and money does have a role in making these hackathons possible, but not to the scale we've come to expect at these events.\n\n### The Future of Hackathons\nWhat might the future of the hackathon look like, if not what it is now? \n\n* **Emphasis on sustainable learning**. Realistically, hackers will not *learn* if all they did was copy tutorials off the internet. Most learning happens through sharing between individuals and teams. Hopefully, we can bake this into the hackathon structure by creating cohorts of hackers for [parallel play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_play) and refocus the hackathon as a means to [learn and explore](/thoughts/books/mindstorms) for the sake of learning and exploring rather than to hit the checkboxes on a rubric.\n* **Realistic Scoping**. Too many of today's hackathons boast that they focus on creating 'hacks for social good.' The reality of the situation is that these complex and nuanced societal problems *cannot* be solved overnight with a simple web app. Either we stop advertising hackathons for good on the timescale of a single weekend, or we increase the timescale of the hackathon from a weekend to months or even years.\n* **Deprioritization of prizes and winning**. Instead, we should provide a space for hackers to play and explore ideas. Obviously in an ideal world, both can happen at the same time, but the rubric-based approach that most hackathons take make these almost mutually exclusive. For now, let's incentivize participation, completion, and novelty over prizes, competition, and winning.\n* **Hacker-focused spending**. Money spent on often unsustainable swag could be much better spent in favour of more emphasis on higher quality venues, food, and accomodations. In doing so, we can work on raising enough money to run a successful event for the hackers rather than a sponsor's notion of a successful event. At the end of the day, money is power. If you have external [funding](thoughts/funding.md) coming in, the expectation is that they have partial influence over the event. Let's make sure that we draw the line where appropriate with sponsors so that the focus remains on the hacker. \n\n### A Promising Pilot\nThe sudden switch to virtual events due to COVID-19 may actually have been the catalyst to the potential future of hackathons. Virtual hackathons this year have shown how successfully we can run events on low budgets that are often 1/10th of our regular running budget. This means we were able to shave off swag, venue, transportation, and food costs to just a tiny fraction of what they used to be. This taste of what hacker-centric hackathons could be like was incredibly exciting to see, almost a glimpse into what the future of hackathons could look like.\n\n![After HackCamp 2020](/posts/images/2020/post-hc.png)*After HackCamp 2020*\n\nThis year, I was responsible for leading logistics at our beginner-focused hackathon called [HackCamp](https://hackcamp.nwplus.io/). To recentre hackathons around learning and to rebuild a healthier hacker culture, we decided to restructure our event into a virtual conference weekend. Here are a few things we changed:\n\n1. We separated learning and workshops from building and hacking and turned it into a two-day hackathon. This allowed hackers to attend workshops and learn without fear of missing out on precious hacking time and to have scheduled sleeping time between the Learn and Build days.\n2. We replaced our 'top' hackathon project awards with a $25 donation to charity for every project submitted. In the past, we've had feedback from hackers saying how this gave them the confidence to finish a project rather than to fail and give up working on the 'perfect' or 'winning' project.\n3. All events were live streamed. This meant that hackers could do the event on their own time and rewatch important events like opening ceremonies while still providing a 'live' viewing experience for those who are available.\n4. We changed judging to be focused on feedback rather than on evaluation. To do so, we replaced exposition judges (who were normally volunteers or company sponsors) with hackers and did peer-to-peer judging. With this approach, each team averaged 7 pieces of feedback.\n\nAlthough this is by no means a full overhaul of the traditional hackathon, we think this is a great pilot into what a more explorative hackathon could look like. We were able to reach over 500+ attendees, 3.2k+ live stream viewers, and over $1200 in donations to charities, and the feedback we got was absolutely stellar.\n\n### Takeaways\nHaving more of the tools to articulate and locate exactly why hackathons have felt increasingly corporate is the first step to reinstate hackathons as third spaces not as places of competition and exploitation, but as places of play and exploration. Hackathons have so much potential to be safe havens for people to find like-minded people away from school assignments or startup grinds or corporate products. \n\nLet's hack the hackathon. This time, with hackers first, not companies. \n\n*Special thanks to Anson, Joice, Ivan, Jasmine, and Jess for reading and helping edit earlier drafts :)*\n\n[^1]: [Hackathons as Co-optation Ritual: Socializing Workers and Institutionalizing Innovation in the \"New\" Economy](https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1575\u0026context=gc_pubs)\n[^2]: [From Counterculture to Cyberculture](https://fredturner.stanford.edu/books/from-counterculture-to-cyberculture/)\n[^3]: [Design Justice: Community-Led Practices To Build the Worlds We Need](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/design-justice)\n[^4]: [*Wired* on Hackathons and Exploitation](https://www.wired.com/story/sociologists-examine-hackathons-and-see-exploitation/)\n[^5]: [Post-it Note City](https://placesjournal.org/article/post-it-note-city)\n[^6]: [*Forbes* on High Turnover Rate in Tech](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinessdevelopmentcouncil/2018/06/29/the-real-problem-with-tech-professionals-high-turnover)\n[^7]: [Beyond Instrumentalization](https://letterstoayoungtechnologist.com/Value-Beyond-Instrumentalization) by Jamie Wang","title":"Hacking the Hackathon"},"/posts/hootsuite":{"content":"---\ntitle: \"Interning at Hootsuite in Highschool\"\ndate: 2019-08-30T08:51:56-07:00\n---\n\n(with insights from Calvin and Hobbes)\n\nSince I’ve started at Hootsuite, I have\n\n* added and/or changed 6223 lines of code in 16 different repos\n\n* closed 24 tickets\n\n* made 4 new Slack emotes\n\n* listened to almost 10,000 minutes of lofi\n\n* had 1 amazing summer at Hootsuite\n\nIncluding the amount of money I’ve spent on lunch this past summer, everything has been so much more than I expected it to be.

Everything at Hootsuite has served to be a once-in-a-lifetime learning opportunity, from learning to build complex services in languages that I’ve never even heard to doing technical demos in front of the entire Product Development team. Despite being a ‘software development’ position, I found myself learning to be a better technical communicator, to have better personal confidence, and so much more.\n\nYet among everything, two big lessons stood out to me:\n\n## The balance of life and work\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*Mj-EMJtcvI4hM_jC.jpg)\n\nPeople often say how elusive good work-life balance is, even to the point of saying that it doesn’t exist. Yet, at my 2 months here at Hootsuite, I can positively say that it is alive and well. We’ve hiked almost 44km across 4 different trails in BC, attended music festivals, and even found niche groups for those interested in bouldering. At the office, there is no shortage of Slack memes and free birthday cake either. On a more serious note, the managers and leads here care deeply about their team members and go out of their way to ensure not only their well-being but also their development as a person.\n\n![Mount Seymour Trail Hike with the team!](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/7936/1*eM_TIZGbBJIz485ssMqKTQ.jpeg)*Mount Seymour Trail Hike with the team!*\n\nThis was a big change from high school where a day at school left me completely drained and just ready to crash. Everything was so focused on grinding for results and doing work that it was hard to make time for myself. At Hootsuite, the community made it feel easy and natural to find the balance that worked for me.\n\nI was still working 8 hours a day, but somehow I felt energized and ready for more each day. It motivated me to make time to take on a freelance web development job just for practice (and to pay rent — living in Vancouver is rough) and even to make a simple project for a friend’s birthday!\n\nI know that this has probably been repeated countless times already, but I cannot stress how important it is to make sure you’re taking enough time off to relax.\n\n## Rejection\n\n\u003e Don’t reject yourself before other people get the chance to\n\n![[December 27th, 1985](https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1985/12/27)](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*Psh-fqFgVeQegGay.jpg)*[December 27th, 1985](https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1985/12/27)*\n\nBecomes sometimes, you just gotta go for it. You probably shouldn’t be going around and ruining nice coffee tables, but it works as a metaphor I guess? The point is: take necessary risks. Don’t say “nah, that’s not possible” before someone else tells you it is. At the start of summer, if someone told me I was going to be doing a demo on a proposal for a massive re-architecture of one of Hootsuite’s core services, I would have told you that you were insane. Yet here I am, doing just that:\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3488/1*P8WSSl993SYILSfw9EfCwg.png)\n\nIf your brain is anything like mine, you often get these nagging self-doubts about whether you’re capable of doing something.

How am I even close to being qualified?\n\nNot wanting to miss the opportunity, I took it. But as I began work, it became clear that I was the biggest critic in the room. They wouldn’t have asked me to do it if they didn’t trust me to do it and to do it well. Moving forward, I tried to trust myself more and to put myself out there, eventually taking on projects that I never thought would’ve been possible:\n\n* Designing prototype service meshes\n\n* Adding endpoints and writing scripts to cleanup user data\n\n* And other crazy things that I probably can’t publicly disclose\n\nIf an opportunity presents itself, jump on it!

Not only does it have some absolutely stunning cover art, it also touches on some thoughts that have been marinating in my head about the intersection of open source and [funding](thoughts/funding.md). So much so, that I’ve started experiencing the Baader-Meinhof effect, seeing something to do with open source and funding everywhere I look in tweets, conversations, and blogs.\n\nThis blog post is an exploration of processes in open source, the value it provides, and how money fits into the picture.\n\n![Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software](/posts/images/paid-oss/oss_book.jpg)*Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software*\n\n### How it's made\n\u003e \"Open source developers were frequently characterized as 'hobby' developers, because the assumption was that only companies could make 'real' software.\"[^1]\n\nAs it stands, there are two primary schools of thought about how open source software is created.\n\n1. **Firm-based** production involves companies, organizations, governments, or any institution with centralized resources. Their driving thesis is that only companies make software because, from a coordination standpoint, centralized firms are the most efficient way to manage resources. Most development done this way is motivated extrinsically by means of monetary compensation.\n   \n2. **Commons-based** production is a more vague concept that involves a distributed group of developers that work on a resource that is used, owned, and governed by its own community - free of  employer affiliations. Most development done this way is motivated intrinsically, people do work because they want to do it.\n\nTraditionally, software has been seen as a product of firms. Open source developers were often treated as hobbyists and the projects they made trivialized as toys. The assumption was that only companies could make ‘real’ software. However, the rise of Internet computing and collaboration tools like Git have decreased the barrier to entry enough that producing software through a commons is now feasible and very much alive. The success of projects like Apache, Linux, and FreeBSD proved just how successful a commons-based method of production could be.\n\nSurprisingly, this may also help to explain why some developers view open source and money as completely separate. If the commons-based method of production is rooted in intrinsic motivation, then money, an extrinsic motivator, will be seen as opposite to core ideals that open source stands for.\n\n\n## Creation vs Maintenance\n\u003e \"Creation is an intrinsic motivator, maintenance usually requires extrinsic motivation\"\n\u003e\n\u003e @balupton, isaacs/github [#167](https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/167)\n\nWhen an artist finishes a painting, or a runner finishes a marathon, that usually signifies the end of said responsibility. There is no such finish line for an open source project, even after pushing out an initial product.\n\nCreating a project is fun. It’s a wild exploration into a new idea, a frivolous journey to create something useful or to learn something new. As cloud platforms continue to eat the world, the costs of distributing and sharing a project are almost completely nullified.\n\nJust a few clicks and a few taps of your keyboard and your project is readily available to any of the 4.66 billion people around the world with internet access. This adrenaline rush of finally releasing the labour of your work onto the world is the moment developers are constantly chasing. For most developers, the process of creation and distribution is intrinsically motivated; it’s an enjoyable process.\n\n[Maintenance is less so.](/thoughts/creation-vs-maintenance) This is akin to a writer that’s been asked to edit and revise the same book day in and day out, long after they’ve reaped the initial financial and reputational rewards from its creation. Even when the creator wants to leave the project to work on something else, they can’t. They’re tightly shackled by the fact that hundreds of thousands of other organizations, companies, and tools rely on their code to keep their operations running. Bringing on additional developers may not help either, as they still require onboarding, code reviews, and general guidance.\n\nCode may be nearly free to create and distribute, but maintenance is still expensive.\n\n## Types of code\n### Code as an artifact\nThere are two main ways we can look at code. The first of which is *static* code. Code that, on its own, does nothing but exists as an archive. Others can copy and download the code without incurring any additional costs to the author. For the maintainers, it should make no difference in regards to cost whether 10 or 10,000 people use it.\n\nThis type of code is a pool resource or [public good](thoughts/public-goods.md), it is\n1. **Non-rivalry.** My ability to copy the code doesn’t affect your ability to copy it. (This isn’t exactly true due to some marginal costs but I’ll discuss this later)\n2. **Non-excludable.** If someone has a copy of the code, it is very difficult to prevent them from sharing that code with others.\n\nAny code that is in this state is easy to share, copy, and distribute. This is the type of code that lives dormant on Github, on StackOverflow answers, and in GitHub’s Arctic Vault[^2]. However, the main purpose of consuming code is not to simply read and study it, but to actually use it and to let it interact with other code.\nIn doing so, we bring it to life.\n\n\n### Code as an organism\n\u003e \"Open source code derives its value not from its static qualities but from its living ones.\"[^1]\n\nAs soon as you hit CTRL-V on that snippet of code, as soon as that static code is inserted into your own, that code comes to life. It might surface  ridiculous amounts of red squigglies, break other code, or force you to rewrite your previous code just to make it work. When code transitions from a resting static state to an active living state, it starts to incur a set of hidden costs.\n\nLike a living organism in a symbiotic relationship, there is a mutual interdependence between it and others in the software ‘ecosystem’ in order to survive. As a result, this ecosystem requires constant upkeep to ensure that components don’t fall out of balance: dependency bumps, documentation updates, and infrastructure changes.\n\n## Free as in speech, not as in beer\n‘Free’ software doesn’t refer to its price. In fact, ‘free’ software is often extremely expensive. As Richard Stallman first described free software, it’s “free as in speech, not free as in beer.” The point Stallman was trying to make was that ‘free’ refers to what one could do with the software, rather than the price tag.\n\n### Latent cost of software\nIn reality, code in its alive state is more like a free puppy. In the beginning, it’s a great and wonderful thing! Super fun and super cute. As it grows and gets older, you realize “geez, it actually takes a lot of my own time to take care of this thing.” Unlike a piece of inanimate furniture, bringing a living creature into one’s home comes with bringing in a new set of responsibilities too.\n\n**Marginal costs** are costs increase on a per-user basis. I mentioned earlier that these costs mean that software is actually rivalrous, meaning that at some point, the project won’t be able to support the n+1th user. Some of this cost comes from physical infrastructure like code hosting and infrastructure. However, the majority of the cost comes from user support. Say you have a billion users and only 0.1% of them require support. If it takes you roughly 10 minutes to resolve each issue, you would still need 20,833 people working 8-hour shifts a day just to be able to keep up with the support volume. Maintainers are constantly wrestling with keeping their issue volume low and questions answered. Eventually, it just becomes a hindrance preventing them from working on the core product.\n\n**Temporal costs** are those which build up and compound over time. Most of it comes from technical debt, choices that are easier today at the expense of time and money in the future. This is the eternal battle against entropy: the inevitable decay of systems over time. When code changes, all the supporting knowledge that surrounds it must be updated too. Documentation, tutorials, programming books, videos, and more slowly become obsolete.\n\nPaying off these latent costs is seldom intrinsically motivated. When people talk about how fun making new projects is or contributing to open source, it’s never referring to writing documentation or refactoring code. This isn’t the ‘fun’ part of writing software. This is the nasty upkeep that goes into maintaining a building from the 1850s that’s had new rooms, plumbing, and electric wiring frankenstein-ed into it over the years.\n\n## Funding Open Source\nI first started on BentoML[^3] as a casual contributor last summer, submitting a few decently sized PRs. It was almost all intrinsically motivated; I found issues that I enjoyed working on and that I knew I would learn lots from. Satisfied with my experience, I decided to join the team as a paid contractor expecting to just continue the type of work I was doing in the summer. As issue after issue piled on, I slowly started to realize just how much extra work being a maintainer meant and why it was a paid position. Making proposals, triaging issues, adding tests, and writing documentation took up the majority of my time. While I recognized it was important work, it was not work I was intrinsically motivated to do. Thus, to motivate people like me to get that work done, an extrinsic motivator -- in this case, money -- needed to be applied.\n\nHow do we best incentivize maintainers to work tasks stripped of the very excitement and promise of creation that initially drew them to the project in the first place? There is a jarring disconnect between work that is needed versus work that is intrinsically motivated. This is where I believe open source funding should play a role. There are two main potential avenues to go about this.\n\n\n### Funding projects\nOne possibility is to fund projects directly. This route builds a brand around the project. The status of the project then transcends any single person’s contributions and becomes a tangible entity that has the brand recognition and reputation that comes with becoming an independent entity.\n\nProjects also tend to attract corporate/government funding much better than individuals can since companies are more comfortable paying for a product (code) than for a one off contract (talent). As part of the transaction, companies are typically promised service availability, influence in decision making, or technical support. However, this tradeoff also means that projects lose a bit of their freedom. Not only do maintainers have to worry about the future of the project, they need to make sure that the agreements laid out between the project and the companies are met too.\n\n### Funding individuals\nA more individualistic model would provide greater flexibility and avoids the centralized governance issues that are so antithetical to what open source stands for. Maintainers then don’t need to deal with figuring out who should get paid how much as each maintainer is responsible for securing their own funding (if even needed). Unlike a company, what each maintainer looks to get from contributing to a project may look completely different. One may be looking to build technical skill, another to gain reputation in the community. From a governance perspective, funding individual developers is also better aligned with the distributed nature of open source projects too.\n\nAs the world’s media moves towards empowering independent creators through platforms like Twitch, YouTube, and TikTok, funding individuals is becoming an increasingly viable option. The way most of these creators make money is through *patronage* rather than donations. Although often conflated with donations, patronage is an interest and commitment to following a creator’s *future* work based on their *current* reputation rather than a one-time tip for their current work.\n\nWhen you are funding an individual, you are paying for the regular delivery of well-defined value.[^1] There are three key parts to this:\n1. **Paying.** This is an ongoing commitment to the production of content, not a one-off payment for one piece of content that catches the eye.\n2. **Regular Delivery.** It isn't random discovery, rather the content is delivered directly to the user via email or application.\n3. **Well-defined value.** It is clear what the money is going towards and what value it is helping provide.\n\nFunding individuals means trusting not just in the projects they are currently working on, but also that they will continue to deliver future value too. Rather than being tied down to one project, creators then have the creative freedom to apply what they learned and create more groundbreaking initiatives.\n\n## Mixing money and open source\n\u003e **Q:** Won't financial rewards adversely affect developer's incentives to contribute?\n\u003e \n\u003e **A:** Yes, but it depends on who you're funding.\n\n[Attention](/thoughts/attention-economy) is the main currency of production. Attention is what you divert when you choose to focus on prioritizing a feature request over adding support for a library that you promised to add a few months back. Attention is what limits you from doing everything at once.\n\nAttention, then, is a common pool resource. It is non-excludable (anyone can bid for their attention) and rivalrous (limited attention). But, by charging for access to maintainer’s attention, it then becomes a private good: excludable and rivalrous. The belief is that, by making attention excludable, the quality of contributions will increase as contributors and users compete for the attention of producers.\n\nThere are two main camps on funding open source projects. The first camp believes that we should pay all maintainers to keep their projects alive. The other camp believes that paying project maintainers will destroy the entire ideology that open source is based upon.\n\nI stand somewhere in between the two camps. I’m a big proponent of “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” There are a lot of competing motivations already, both intrinsic and extrinsic, that powers open source today. We shouldn’t touch the parts that are currently working. Rather, we should focus on funding places that are absent from existing motivation like software maintenance and documentation\n\n## Conclusion\nThere is an abundance of open source projects and casual contributors as it stands today. With the ever lowering barrier to entry, these will only become more abundant. Casual contributors already incur a marginal cost on maintainers, their contributions need a maintainer to review whether it’s okay to merge or not. Adding more extrinsic motivation will just exacerbate this existing problem. This is the same reason why initiatives like Hacktoberfest, which promises to give a free t-shirt to anyone who makes a few pull requests, are counterproductive to open source.\n\nWhat isn’t significantly increasing are the number of maintainers responsible for maintaining the existing projects we have today. We should be funding maintainers who already have the contextual knowledge to be able to effectively tackle issues and guide the project. Funding will be an important extrinsic motivator to make sure that the difficult work that needs to be done, gets done.\n\nThis is not, by any means, an all-encompassing post about funding in open source. If that’s what you’re looking for, then Eghbal’s book is a great starting point. What this post does do, however, is raise important points about the processes behind open source and prod at why exactly we need to fund these seemingly ‘free’ processes. In order for open source to continue on its growth trajectory, these are questions we need to put more collective effort into thinking about.\n\n[^1]: *Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software* by [Nadia Eghbal](https://nadiaeghbal.com/)\n[^2]: [GitHub's Arctic Vault](https://archiveprogram.github.com/)\n[^3]: [BentoML](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML)","title":"A case for funding Open Source"},"/posts/react":{"content":"---\ntitle: \"React in 30 minutes or your money back\"\ndate: 2021-08-07T08:38:11-04:00\n---\n\nReact is, as the [website](https://reactjs.org/) says, \"a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.\" What this means exactly, is often confusing to people.\n\nMany articles claim to teach you \"React in 10 minutes\" but rarely go beyond a few code examples. The problem is that this leaves you with an inkling of what React looks like and maybe how to write a bit of it, but no clue *why* it works and how to think about fixing React bugs.\n\nThis isn’t some random tutorial which throws you a bunch of example code that you go on to copy-and-paste and then leaves you hanging wondering what it does. The goal of the workshop is to give attendees a good foundation of the concepts within React, why people choose to use React, and how it works behind the hood. Hopefully, this gives you a good enough foundation to hit the ground running and avoid entire classes of bugs when starting out in React!\n\nThis post assumes that you know basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\n\n## What is React?\nThe TLDR; is that it's a bunch of code you can add to your project that makes building websites and interfaces that **react** to changes when you do things (e.g. press buttons) really easy.\n\nReact has two distinguishing features that set it apart:\n1. React is **declarative** meaning you tell React exactly what you want the page to look like and it'll figure out how to do that.\n2. React is **component based** meaning that you can create pieces of the UI that you can reuse across different parts of your application.\n\n## How a website works\nMost likely, you've written some code for a website in plain old HTML before. This, as you know, defines the structure for what is inside a webpage. If the webpage is a house, the HTML is the blueprint that tells you what the house should generally look like and what is inside.\n\nYet, to turn that bunch of HTML into something displayable in your web browser, it needs to parse it into a more intermediate format it can more easily work with: the Document Object Model (DOM).\n\nThe nested structure of the HTML lends itself very well to a tree-like structure which the browser can then efficiently traverse and make updates to.\n\n![Turning HTML into the DOM and then into the actual site](/posts/images/react/html-dom-site.png)*Turning HTML into the DOM and then into the actual site*\n\n## How React works\n### The Virtual DOM\nOf course, you can still manipulate and interact with the regular DOM [through JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction) still but the main gripe that React has with this way of manipulating the DOM (e.g. adding new things to the screen or modifying existing bits on the page) is that it can be *realllyyy* slow in some cases.\n\nThis is where the mystical **virtual DOM** comes in. Modifying the DOM in a declarative way is difficult because modifying the real DOM is imperative by nature, making it difficult to write declarative applications. You could use `element.innerHTML = 'your html'` in a declarative fashion, but an in-memory version implemented in JavaScript would be faster than using `innerHTML`, which is exactly exactly what React does. React creates a virtual DOM where it keeps track of what it would *like* the real DOM to look like and then intelligently batches and combines changes together to optimize and squeeze the most performance out of the few expensive writes to the real DOM that it actually does. More info on [how DOM diffing and patching works](https://buildwithreact.com/tutorial/under-the-hood) under the hood for those curious.\n\n\u003e Please note that Virtual DOM is not faster than raw, imperative operations on the real DOM (best performance). React uses the Virtual DOM because it is a relatively efficient way of declaratively representing your UI from state, and much faster compared to straight `innerHTML` calls.\n\n![React's Virtual DOM in action. ReactDOM.render() tells React to attach your React components to the real DOM](/posts/images/react/virtual-DOM.png)*React's Virtual DOM in action. ReactDOM.render() tells React to attach your React components to the real DOM*\n\n### Components\nAnother things that React tackles really well is that regular HTML and JS makes it a lot more difficult than it should be to re-use the same UI and logic across different pages on your website.\n\n![What if you wanted to reuse this 'product card' component?](/posts/images/react/component-reuse.png)*What if you wanted to reuse this 'product card' component?*\n\nThe main philosophy of functional React is that you shouldn't override and inherit behaviour. Instead, get the behaviour you want by creating and composing reusable *components*. Each of these components can hold some sort of data of its own, called its **state**. Each component can also take in a few arguments or parameters called **properties** or **props** for short. Each component is composed up of either primative HTML elements (e.g. `\u003cdiv\u003e` or `\u003ch1\u003e`) or other React components. The elements that a component is made up of are called its **children**.\n\n![React Component Diagram](/posts/images/react/component-diagram.png)*React Component Diagram*\n\nBecause React uses composition to build components, there is a natural *downward flow of information*, where components pass data to their children. Thus, to change a parent's state, the parent needs to explicitly pass a callback function that allows that behaviour to the child (e.g. an arrow function that wraps the `setState` function for the parent). This is detailed more in the 'Building an App section'.\n\n### JSX\nJSX is a extension to regular JS which lets you write HTML-like code to define React components. It is declarative at heart, meaning you describe exactly what you want the component to look like based off of some given data (props and state in this case) and React will figure out how to get the page to look like that.\n\nJSX can be just regular HTML.\n\n```jsx\n\u003cdiv\u003eBottom Text\u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\nIt can also be a user-defined component. In this case, the component has no children or 'inner HTML' so we can write its shorthand.\n\n```jsx\n\u003cExampleComponent/\u003e\n```\n\nWe can also pass in properties to a component by adding a tag with that property name. Any string can be passed in regularly, or you can also choose to pass in any JS expression (e.g. number, function, object, etc.) by enclosing it in curly braces.\n\n```jsx\n\u003cHello name=\"World\" someData={2 + 3}/\u003e\n```\n\nTo 'compose' components, you can nest them as children within each other.\n\n```jsx\n\u003cDashboard\u003e\n  \u003cGreeting/\u003e\n  \u003cStatistics\u003e\n    \u003cBarChart data={data}/\u003e\n    \u003cPieChart data={data}/\u003e\n  \u003c/Statistics\u003e\n\u003c/Dashboard\u003e\n```\n\nGreat, so that's just what JSX *looks like*, how do we use it in React? The first thing to note is that a **component in React is defined as a function which returns some JSX**.\n\nHere's a simple 'Hello World' component in React! We then write a return statement that defines exactly how to render this component (i.e. what children make up this component).\n\nNote that React passes us all of the props from the parent in a 'props' object. Then, in the return statement's JSX, we can then access the name property by using `{}` to indicate a JS expression and accessing the 'name' field in the `props` object.\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react'\n\nfunction Greeting(props) {\n  return \u003cp\u003eHello {props.name}!\u003c/p\u003e\n}\n```\n\nLet's say we want to create a `\u003cHelloWorld/\u003e` component that re-uses our `\u003cGreeting/\u003e` component from above.\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react'\n\nfunction HelloWorld() {\n  return \u003cdiv\u003e\n    \u003ch1\u003eMy Hello World App\u003c/h1\u003e\n    \u003cGreeting name=\"World!\"/\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n}\n```\n\nThen, at the end, we tell React to finally render our `\u003cHelloWorld/\u003e` component into the actual DOM by using `ReactDOM.render(...)`. Here, we choose to replace the element with the id 'root' in the real DOM with our `\u003cHelloWorld/\u003e` component.\n\n```jsx\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom'\n\nReactDOM.render(HelloWorld, document.getElementById('root'))\n```\n\n## Life Cycle\nSo far we've covered static components using just plain old JSX and data passing using props, but this misses the biggest benefit that React offers: reactivity to data changes. We'll look a little at the life cycle of React components to see where we can update a component when data changes.\n\nThere are three main parts to the life cycle to a React component. They are mounted, updated, and eventually unmounted.\n\n![React Component Lifecycle](/posts/images/react/lifecycle.png)*React Component Lifecycle*\n\n### Mount\nMounting happens when the component is first added to the virtual DOM. Here, we set the initial state of the component (e.g. to track the number of clicks, a user's input, etc.) and tell React to update the DOM.\n\n### Update\nAn update happens when its parent component is updated or when its state or props changes. Here, we can modify the state of the component, do asyncronous things (like call an API), and rerender the component.\n\n### Unmount\nThe unmount happens when the parent component is no longer rendered to the DOM. Now, we cleanup anything that needs to be cleaned up, destroying all state, and removing the component from the DOM.\n\n## Hooks\nNote that when a component updates, React will call the component again with the new props thus **clearing all local state**. This is why you can't just declare a new `const` inside a component for state. Introducing: hooks! They are JavaScript functions that allow us to 'hook' into the React lifecycle and do things like fetch data and persist state.\n\n### useState\nLet's say we want to track how many times a user has clicked a button. A naive implementation might look something like this, where we define a variable in the scope of the component.\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react'\n\nfunction Counter() {\n  let count = 0\n\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003eYou clicked {count} times\u003c/p\u003e\n      \u003cbutton onClick={() =\u003e count++}\u003e\n        Increment\n      \u003c/button\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\nHowever, this will not work! Because React doesn't know about the count variable, incrementing it will not update the component and thus not re-render it onto the screen. To register a component's state with React, we use the `useState` hook.\n\nThis will allow React to preserve the state between re-renders. `useState` returns a pair: a read-only variable representing the _current_ state value and a function that lets you set a new value for the state.\n\nThe first parameter to the `useState` hook is the default value that React should assign to the state when the component is first mounted.\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { useState } from 'react'\n\nfunction Counter() {\n  // Declare a new state variable called count initialized to 0\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)\n\n  // When the button is clicked, update the count to be\n  // the previous count + 1\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003eYou clicked {count} times\u003c/p\u003e\n      \u003cbutton onClick={() =\u003e setCount(count + 1)}\u003e\n        Increment\n      \u003c/button\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\nNow when the button is clicked, the count is then incremented by one. Because we used the `useState` hook, React knows about this component state and will then known to re-render the component when the state is updated.\n\nNote that you **cannot** directly modify the `count` variable because it is read-only. If you want to mutate it, use the `setCount` function that is returned from the hook.\n\n#### A note about syntax\nBecause this is just using JavaScript's [destructuring assignment syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment), we can call the variable whatever we want.\n\n```jsx\nconst [count, setCount] = useState(0)\n\n// is equivalent to\n\nconst state = useState(0) // state is an array of length 2\nconst count = state[0]\nconst setCount = state[1]\n```\n\n### useEffect\nAsynchronous data fetching, manually changing the window title, and setting recurring events are all examples of side effects. Yet, React won't let us do that right now because we have no way to do things in between the mount and unmount lifecycle events.\n\nIntroducing the `useEffect` hook, which lets us peform side effects within components.\n\nLet's consider the previous example of keeping track of amount of times the user has clicked a button. What if we want to set the window title to be the number of times the button has been clicked so far?\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'\n\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)\n\n  // setup a new effect that runs everytime `count` is updated\n  // this will re-render the component too\n  useEffect(() =\u003e {\n    document.title = `${count} clicks`\n  }, [count])\n\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003eYou clicked {count} times\u003c/p\u003e\n      \u003cbutton onClick={() =\u003e setCount(count + 1)}\u003e\n        Increment\n      \u003c/button\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\n`useEffect` doesn't return anything, but takes two parameters. The first is the callback which is the effect we want to run, this callback takes 0 parameters. The second parameter is the array of dependencies for the effect. React uses this array to determine when to re-run our effect (you can optionally omit this entire array to re-run the effect *every* time the component updates).\n\n### useSWR\nWhat about making API requests to fetch user data or data from an external third-party? While technically you can do this with `useEffect` and `useState`, it gets messy really quickly.\n\nThis hook isn't an official React one, but I use it so much in my projects that it might as well be. Introducing `useSWR`, a [hook from Vercel](https://swr.vercel.app/) that lets you make asynchronous HTTP requests extremely easily.\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react'\nimport useSWR from 'swr'\n\n// a function that performs an http request and returns a response\n// this can be reused across all of your requests\nconst fetcher = url =\u003e fetch(url).then(res =\u003e res.json())\n\nfunction Profile() {\n  // example HTTP GET request to /api/user\n  const { data, error } = useSWR('/api/user', fetcher)\n\n  // we can use conditional rendering to display\n  // error or loading messages\n  if (error) return \u003cdiv\u003efailed to load\u003c/div\u003e\n  if (!data) return \u003cdiv\u003eloading...\u003c/div\u003e\n\n  // if the code reaches this point, we know\n  // that our request will have finished and have no errors!\n  return \u003cdiv\u003eHello {data.name}!\u003c/div\u003e\n}\n```\n\n### Order matters\nOne really common beginner mistake that I made a lot when first starting out is that **hooks need to be called in the exact same order every time.** This means that you can't have hooks after any conditional returns, inside `if` statements, or inside function/callback definitions.\n\n```jsx\n// DON'T: conditionally run hook\nif (someCondition) {\n  useEffect(() =\u003e {\n    // run effect here\n  })\n}\n\n// DO: put conditional inside the hook\nuseEffect(() =\u003e {\n  if (someCondition) {\n    // run effect here\n  }\n})\n```\n\nFor more information, read the [official React docs on this](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html#only-call-hooks-at-the-top-level).\n\n## Building an App\nGreat, so now you have all this theory. You're probably itching to build something and that's exactly what this section is for! We'll be building a very basic **todo application** where you can add and remove from the list. For this bit, a basic understanding of [Git and GitHub](https://resources.nwplus.io/2-beginner/how-to-git-github.html) is required.\n\nFirst, make you install a version of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) `\u003e= 12.x`. If you are unsure, you can check your Node version by doing `node -v`.\n\n```bash\n$ node -v\nv12.14.0 # good to go!\n```\n\n### Starter Code\nNormally, most people will tell you to run `create-react-app` here to create a new React application, but I find that `create-react-app` has way too much boilerplate (extra code) for my taste so I made my own more stripped down version of `create-react-app`. It contains everything you need to get started with a new React app and, in my opinion, is a lot less confusing.\n\nTo get started open your terminal of choice and clone this [minimal React template](https://github.com/jackyzha0/min-react). This will give you all the code you need to get started!\n\n```bash\n# clone the repository\n$ git clone https://github.com/jackyzha0/min-react.git\n\n# navigate to folder\n$ cd min-react\n\n# install dependencies\n$ npm i\n\n# run local dev server! (open localhost:3000 in your browser)\n$ npm run start\n```\n\nThen, let's remove some of the starter files we don't need. Delete the `src/components` folder. We'll be working `src/App.js` for the rest of this tutorial.\n\n### Creating the App component\nLet's delete what's in `src/App.js` and start fresh. What do we need in our todo app? Well, we need to track the list of todos the user has. Let's create a state for that and initialize it with a few default todos. Then, the component should just be a container for all of our todo items. We can just map over the `todos` state and turn them into `\u003cTodoItem\u003e` components!\n\nWe can keep the styling from the template just so it looks a bit nicer.\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { useState } from 'react'\nimport styled from 'styled-components'\n\n// custom styling using styled-components!\nconst AppContainer = styled.div`\n margin: 40vh 30vw;\n`\n\nfunction App() {\n  // setup todos\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([\"do laundry\", \"finish homework\"])\n\n  // app is composed up of all the current todos\n  return (\n    \u003cAppContainer\u003e\n      \u003ch1\u003etodos\u003c/h1\u003e\n      {todos.map((item, i) =\u003e \u003cTodoItem\n        key={i}\n        name={item}\n      /\u003e)}\n    \u003c/AppContainer\u003e\n  )\n}\n\nexport default App\n```\n\nThe problem is, we don't have a `\u003cTodoItem\u003e` component yet. Let's make it!\n\n### Creating a Todo component (Component Styling)\nWe need a component to display each of our todo items. The only prop we really need is the name of the todo to display it so we'll make a simple component; no need to track state or anything.\n\n```jsx\nfunction TodoItem(props) {\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003e{props.name}\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\nLet's add a hover state so that the item has a strikethrough effect when you hover over it. We can do this using `styled-components` which is a way for us to add CSS to our components really easily.\n\n```jsx\n// create a 'styled' div that has a strikethrough on hover\nconst TodoItemContainer = styled.div`\n  \u0026:hover \u003e p {\n    text-decoration: line-through;\n  }\n`\n\nfunction TodoItem(props) {\n  // replace the original div with the `TodoItemContainer`\n  // styled div we just created\n  return (\n    \u003cTodoItemContainer\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003e{props.name}\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003c/TodoItemContainer\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\nGreat! Now let's see what that looks like.\n\n![Our todo app with a strikethrough effect!](/posts/images/react/todo-0.png)*Our todo app with a strikethrough effect!*\n\n### Deleting a Todo (Passing callbacks)\nHmm, would be great if we could actually delete a todo by just clicking on a todo item. Good thing [React has event handlers](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html) just like regular HTML elements do! Let's modify our `\u003cTodoItem\u003e` to handle a click event. To do that, we just pass a callback to the the desired component using the `onClick` prop.\n\n```jsx\nfunction TodoItem(props) {\n  return (\n    \u003cTodoItemContainer\n      onClick={() =\u003e {\n        alert(`You finished ${props.name}!`)\n      }}\n    \u003e\n      \u003cp\u003e{props.name}\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003c/TodoItemContainer\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\nNow, when we click each todo item, our page will give us an alert saying we completed that item! Not super useful though. Can we just delete the item from the component?\n\nRecall from earlier that with React, information flows *downward* in the component hierarchy tree. This means that in order to modify the state of the parent (`\u003cApp\u003e` in this case), we need to pass a callback that helps us modify the information.\n\nTo do that, we create a `deleteTodo` function in `\u003cApp\u003e` and then pass an anonymous function to each todo which deletes that given todo. Note that because we can't directly modify the `todos` variable as it is read-only, we create a copy of it using the spread syntax (`[...todos]`), then remove a single element by index using splice.\n\n```jsx\nfunction App() {\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([\"do laundry\", \"finish homework\"])\n\n  // callback to remove a todo\n  const deleteTodo = (index) =\u003e {\n    // copy current todos\n    const newTodos = [...todos]\n    // remove todo at given index\n    newTodos.splice(index, 1)\n    setTodos(newTodos)\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \u003cAppContainer\u003e\n      \u003ch1\u003etodos\u003c/h1\u003e\n      {todos.map((item, i) =\u003e \u003cTodoItem\n        key={i}\n        name={item}\n        deleteCallback={() =\u003e deleteTodo(i)}\n      /\u003e)}\n    \u003c/AppContainer\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThen, we update `\u003cTodoItem\u003e` to use this callback on click.\n\n```jsx\nfunction TodoItem(props) {\n  return (\n    \u003cTodoItemContainer onClick={props.deleteCallback}\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003e{props.name}\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003c/TodoItemContainer\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\nGreat, so now we have display and deletion. Adding new todos is up next!\n\n### Adding a Todo (Form Inputs)\nFirst, let's create a short form component that will allow us to accept user input. Let's setup a state field for the user input and create a form with a single text input. To update the state of the component as the user types, we attach an `onChange` event handler to the `\u003cinput\u003e` which sets the value of the `todo` state to whatever the input field is.\n\n```jsx\nfunction TodoForm(props) {\n  // form state\n  const [todo, setTodo] = useState(\"\")\n\n  return (\n    \u003cform\u003e\n      \u003cinput\n        type=\"text\"\n        value={todo}\n        onChange={e =\u003e setTodo(e.target.value)}\n      /\u003e\n    \u003c/form\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\nNow, let's handle what happens when the user submits this form (i.e. presses enter). We add an `onSubmit` handler to the form to handle this. Note that we specifically tell the browser to *not* refresh the page (which is the default behaviour for a form submission) and clear the form state.\n\nBy telling React that the value of the `\u003cinput\u003e` is equal to the component state `todo`, React knows that this is a [controlled component](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components), meaning that the component state is the **single source of truth** here.\n\n```jsx\nfunction TodoForm(props) {\n  const [todo, setTodo] = useState(\"\")\n\n  const handleSubmit = (e) =\u003e {\n    // prevent form from refreshing page\n    e.preventDefault()\n\n    // show an alert with user input\n    alert(todo)\n\n    // clear form\n    setTodo(\"\")\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \u003cform onSubmit={handleSubmit}\u003e\n      \u003cinput\n        type=\"text\"\n        value={todo}\n        onChange={e =\u003e setTodo(e.target.value)}\n      /\u003e\n    \u003c/form\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\nLet's add a bit of styling to make the text box not as ugly and add `\u003cTodoForm\u003e` to the end of the todos list so it actually gets rendered.\n\n```jsx\nconst TodoInput = styled.input`\n padding: 0.7em 0.5em;\n border: 1px solid black;\n border-radius: 4px;\n`\n\nfunction TodoForm(props) {\n  const [todo, setTodo] = useState(\"\")\n\n  const handleSubmit = (e) =\u003e {\n    // prevent form from refreshing page\n    e.preventDefault()\n\n    // show an alert with user input\n    alert(todo)\n\n    // clear form\n    setTodo(\"\")\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \u003cform onSubmit={handleSubmit}\u003e\n      \u003cTodoInput\n        type=\"text\"\n        placeholder=\"Add a new todo...\"\n        value={todo}\n        onChange={e =\u003e setTodo(e.target.value)}\n      /\u003e\n    \u003c/form\u003e\n  )\n}\n\nfunction App() {\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([\"do laundry\", \"finish homework\"])\n\n  const deleteTodo = (index) =\u003e {\n    const newTodos = [...todos]\n    newTodos.splice(index, 1)\n    setTodos(newTodos)\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \u003cAppContainer\u003e\n      \u003ch1\u003etodos\u003c/h1\u003e\n      {todos.map((item, i) =\u003e \u003cTodoItem\n        key={i}\n        name={item}\n        deleteCallback={() =\u003e deleteTodo(i)}\n      /\u003e)}\n      \u003cTodoForm/\u003e\n    \u003c/AppContainer\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\nLooking snazzy!\n\n![A nice new 'Add Todo' field!](/posts/images/react/todo-1.png)*A nice new 'Add Todo' field!*\n\nFinally, let's link this up back to the main `\u003cApp\u003e` state so that adding a new todo actually modifies the state of the app. We create a `addTodo` callback and pass this to the `\u003cTodoForm\u003e` component through using a `addCallback` prop.\n\n```jsx\nfunction TodoForm(props) {\n  const [todo, setTodo] = useState(\"\")\n\n  const handleSubmit = (e) =\u003e {\n    e.preventDefault()\n    // use the provided 'addCallback' prop\n    props.addCallback(todo)\n    setTodo(\"\")\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \u003cform onSubmit={handleSubmit}\u003e\n      \u003cTodoInput\n        type=\"text\"\n        placeholder=\"Add a new todo...\"\n        value={todo}\n        onChange={e =\u003e setTodo(e.target.value)}\n      /\u003e\n    \u003c/form\u003e\n  )\n}\n\nfunction App() {\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([\"do laundry\", \"finish homework\"])\n\n  const deleteTodo = (index) =\u003e {\n    const newTodos = [...todos]\n    newTodos.splice(index, 1)\n    setTodos(newTodos)\n  }\n\n  // callback to add a new todo\n  const addTodo = (todo) =\u003e {\n    const newTodos = [...todos, todo]\n    setTodos(newTodos)\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \u003cAppContainer\u003e\n      \u003ch1\u003etodos\u003c/h1\u003e\n      {todos.map((item, i) =\u003e \u003cTodoItem\n        key={i}\n        name={item}\n        deleteCallback={() =\u003e deleteTodo(i)}\n      /\u003e)}\n      \u003cTodoForm addCallback={addTodo} /\u003e\n    \u003c/AppContainer\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Finished App\nAnd with that, you've finished your first React application! To recap, you've learned\n\n1. What React is\n2. How React works\n3. The React Component Lifecycle\n4. React Hooks\n5. and much more!\n\nHopefully this leaves you in a really good position to becoming more comfortable with React.

Part 1 will touch on defining the problem we’re trying to solve, the data we have, and how we pre-processed it. Part 2 will focus on the architecture of the model we built, how well it does, and thoughts on improving it for the future.\n\n## The problem\n\nClassifying intents is at the core of reflect. When a user inputs an intent, its reflect’s job to figure out whether that intent should let them into the website.\n\n\u003e How do we make sure “do some marketing work for reflect” is classified as productive but “watch cute dog videos” isn’t?\n\n## Why it’s so difficult\n\nA lot of it comes down to the fact that natural language processing (NLP) is a very difficult task. What does the sentence “learn about physics” mean, and how is it semantically different from “asdflkj I can’t do work”?\n\nWe can’t just parse for keywords and just allow a user in if we see the word “work” because that word can mean different things in different contexts. For example, “I’m not doing any work right now” would have otherwise been classified as valid. Thus, we can employ the help of a machine learning algorithm to help us capture this deeper meaning.\n\nSpecifically, the form of machine learning we will be using is called **supervised learning,** in which we give an algorithm a bunch of labelled data, tell it what it’s doing wrong, and let it ‘learn.’ Through doing this, hopefully the algorithm will be able to generalize and make predictions on unseen data too.\n\n## The data\n\nOf course, if we want to perform supervised learning, we’re going to need a lot of data. Where are we going to get all of it? Luckily, we were able to get it through 3 different sources.\n\n### Survey data (444 entries)\n\nOur team sent out an interest survey in early January in which we asked 3 questions:\n\n1. How would you answer if you were trying to visit a distracting site while trying to focus? (eg. youtube, facebook, etc)\n\n1. How would you answer if you were trying to visit a distracting site to take a quick break from your work? (eg. youtube, facebook, etc)\n\n1. How would you answer if you were trying to visit a distracting site like Facebook but to do work? (e.g. make a marketing post)\n\nWe used these answers to form the basis of our very first dataset. We ended up getting a surprising amount of entries, ending with 148 responses to 3 questions and totalling 444 different observations. Here’s what some of that data looks like after tidying it up:\n\n\u003e We classified any answer to Q1 as invalid and Q2 + Q3 as valid\n\n\n| intent | valid |\n|-|-|\n| I am watching a 5 minute video to take my mind off not being productive :/ | no |\n| I'm just bored | no |\n| I’m bored/tired and trying to relax | no |\n| ... | ... |\n| work is pretty boring, i need to take a quick break I just can't focus atm | yes |\n| I finished all my work for today so I'm going to take a break now! | yes |\n| getting some advertising done for my club | yes |\n| I need to make a post on Twitter for my job announcing the latest update to our site | yes |\n| I'm trying to network | yes |\n| ... | ... |\n\n\n### Closed Beta (790 entries)\n\nAfter we made a basic dataset, we were able to make our first (admittedly not great) model. But in doing so, this let us create an MVP to which we could use to actually test with. We then deployed this model for use to our closed beta testers and collected their responses (with consent of course!) along with the website it was input on. This was then converted into a .csv file. A few examples are show below:\n\n| intent | url |\n|-|-|\n| to do some marketing | facebook.com/ |\n| i cannot focus on my work | instagram.com/ |\n| fuel my crippling social media addiction | facebook.com/ |\n| ... | ... |\n\nThese were then hand-labelled by our reflect team in a similar format as the survey data we collected earlier.\n\n| intent | valid |\n|-|-|\n| to do some marketing | yes |\n| i cannot focus on my work | no |\n| fuel my crippling social media addiction | no |\n| ... | ... |\n\n### Closed Beta Corrections (37 entries)\n\nFinally, we created a Google Forms through which we directly asked beta testers if a decision made by reflect’s intent classifier was faulty. Specifically, we asked what they input, and what they expected. Here are a few examples:\n\n\n| input | valid |\n|-|-|\n| reply to a friend about a lab | yes |\n| listening to a youtube music playlist | yes |\n| goof off as much as possible | yes |\n|...|...|\n\n\nThis entire section of the dataset was only 37 observations, but it drastically helped us reduce false positives and false negatives by focusing specifically on misclassifications.\n\nAfter aggregating and combing all our data into one common format, we ended up with a grand total of 1271 observations. They looked something like this:\n\n\n| input | expected |\n|-|-|\n| fail school by watching youtube | no |\n| sdlkjasd | no |\n| making a quick product post (should take \u003c10 min) | yes |\n| ... | ... |\n\n\n### So?\n\nNow that we have the data, can we just throw it into a machine learning model? Unfortunately, the answer is no, not quite yet.\n\n## Data augmentation\n\nOur dataset is still pretty small, even after aggregating all of our data. It most definitely doesn’t cover all of our bases for all the possible things that future users could possibly input. So, how can we “upsample” our data to get more of it? Well, it turns out that the field of Natural Language Processing has quite a few tricks to augment our data.\n\n### Sentence Variation\n\nEssentially what sentence variation is, is just replacing a few words of given sentences with their synonyms. If we have a sentence like “I’m trying to make a marketing post,” we can swap out singular words with their synonyms and tell our network that it means the same thing.\n\nIn this example, we could get something like “I’m attempting to fabricate a marketing post”. Adding these additional sentence variations will allow our machine learning model to learn semantic relationships between similar words (e.g. fabricate and make have similar meaning)\n\n### Sentence Negation\n\nAdditionally, if we add a ‘not’ in the sentence, it should flip the meaning of the sentence. An example would be “learning about physics” is valid, whereas “not learning about physics” is not. However, if the sentence already contains ‘not’ (e.g. “I’m not being productive”), adding another ‘not’ would make the sentence too complex and obfuscated, so we just label it as invalid. In essence, we just add ‘not’ to a bunch of sentences and label them as invalid. This helps us to combat intents which use negations in a sort of round-a-bout way to confuse the algorithm.\n\n### Shuffled Sentences\n\nIf we take an existing, valid sentence and completely shuffle the words, the resulting sentence should be invalid. An example would be “to watch a crash course video*” should be valid whereas “video course a watch crash to*” should be invalid. Basically, we’re just shuffling existing sentences and also labelling them as invalid. This helps us to combat intents which grammatically make no sense, but are otherwise valid.\n\n### Garbage Sentences\n\nWe can also take completely random words from the English language and put them together. The resulting sentences should all be invalid. For example, “*untinkered phalangitis shaly quinovic dish spadiciflorous unshaved” *clearly makes no sense. However, the addition of these gibberish sentences allows our model to be more robust against foreign words and out-of-vocabulary terms.\n\n### Vocabulary-mix Sentences\n\nLast but definitely not least, we can take the most common words in our dataset and mash them together. This should yield us a bunch of sentences which contain “key words” but should be marked as invalid because the context in which they are used makes no sense. For example, “video look watching” and “get research facebook take need want need message watch” are both clearly gibberish sentences, but they have a lot of keywords that one would think would let you in (e.g. video, research, watching, etc.). This lets us be more robust against those who try to get around the algorithm using keywords.\n\n## Data preprocessing\n\nWhat about now? Can we throw it into the neural network yet? Well, no. We may have increased the amount of data we have to work with, but we also need to convert it to a form that is easy to understand for both the computer and for our algorithm. We do that with a series of functions that we apply on our data.\n\n### Strip punctuation\n\nAs the name suggests, we remove all punctuation from the input phrase. We found that including the punctuation hurt our performance, most likely due to the fact that they offer very little in terms of semantic meaning and obfuscate the real meaning of the sentence.\n\n```python\nstripPunctuation(\"I don't know if I'm being productive! :(\") \n\u003e \"I dont know if Im being productive\"\n```\n\n### Make everything lowercase\n\nAdditionally, we found that in this particular setting, capital letters also didn’t matter that much. Because of the nature we collect our data (just a simple textbox), users tend to not bother with capitalization. As such, we remove it to make it consistent across our data.\n\n```python\nlower(\"I dont know if Im being productive\")\n\u003e \"i dont know if im being productive\"\n```\n\n### Expand contractions\n\nThe English language does this weird thing where we can just smush two words together (e.g. “I am” to “I’m”). Unfortunately for us, these produce extra complexity in our model that we could reduce by making them all consistent. In our case, we chose to expand all of these contractions.\n\n```python\nexpandContractions(\"i dont know if im being productive\") \n\u003e \"i do not know if i am being productive\"\n```\n\n### Remove stop words\n\nThe English language also has a bunch of these things called **stop words** — words that do not contribute anything major to the sentence in terms of semantic understanding (usually in the context of natural language tasks such as this). A few examples of them are ‘I’, ‘me’, ‘my’, ‘by’, and ‘on’. By removing them, we once again remove unneeded complexity from the model.\n\n```python\nrmStopwords(\"i do not know if i am being productive\") \n\u003e \"not know productive\"\n```\n\n### Tokenization\n\nHowever, these words are not super friendly for machine learning algorithms who would much rather deal with integers and floating point numbers than words and sentences. How do we fix this?\n\nWell, one thing we can do is turn words in indices by how often they appear, capped at the most common 1000 words — in essence, creating a vocabulary list mapping common words to numbers. For example, if “the” is the most common word, we convert it to 1. If “work” is the 8th most common word, we convert it to 8. For anything that isn’t in the top 1000, we give it the value of 0.\n\n```python\ntokenize(\"not know productive\") \n\u003e [12, 35, 7]\n```\n\n### Fixed sequence length\n\nFinally, we need to ensure that all the inputs are the same length of simplicity sake. If we were to handle dynamic length inputs, it would introduce a whole other level of complexity that we’re really not ready to deal with. As such, we can make sure all the inputs are the same length by adding a bunch of zeros to those who are too short (zero padding) or by slicing those who are too long.\n\n```python\npad([12, 35, 7], 10) \n\u003e [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 12, 35, 7]\n```\n\n### Finally\n\nAfter all of these functions have been applied, we have successfully converted a complex sentence into a series of ‘tokens’ that is easy to understand for the machine learning algorithm.\n\n```python\npreprocess(\"I don’t know if I’m being productive! :(\")\n\u003e [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 12, 35, 7]\n```\n\n## What’s next?\n\nNow that we have something ready to feed into our neural network, let’s dive into how the actual model itself works! How do we tell that this is a “valid” intent?\n\n## The model\n\nThe type of neural network that we’ll be using is called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).\n\n![credit: Christopher Olah, 2015](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4000/0*HyoZq6fOfsnn2YOC)*credit: Christopher Olah, 2015*\n\nWhat’s so special about these networks is that they are really good at modelling time-series data, making it an ideal candidate for tasks like forecasting or natural language processing.\n\n```python\n# Function to create a RNN model with given parameters\n# max_seq_len: maximum token sequence length\n# vocab_size:  size of tokenizer vocabulary\ndef RNN(max_seq_len, vocab_size):\n    inputs = Input(name='inputs', shape=[max_seq_len])\n    layer = Embedding(vocab_size, 64, input_length=max_seq_len)(inputs)\n    layer = LSTM(64, return_sequences = True)(layer)\n    layer = Dropout(0.5)(layer)\n    layer = LSTM(64)(layer)\n    layer = Dense(256, name='FC1')(layer)\n    layer = Dropout(0.5)(layer)\n    layer = Dense(1, name='out_layer')(layer)\n    layer = Activation('sigmoid')(layer)\n    model = Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=layer)\n    return model\n```\n\nHere’s how we define it in our [Keras code](https://github.com/jackyzha0/reflect-nlp/blob/master/nlp/net.py), don’t worry if you don’t understand it just yet! We’ll explain it in the next few paragraphs.\n\n```python\ninputs = Input(name='inputs', shape=[max_seq_len])\n```\n\nRight off the bat, you’ll notice that the first layer is the Input layer. Basically, this tells Keras to instantiate a new tensor (a multi-dimensional vector) with a given shape. In this case, we’re creating a one-dimensional tensor that is max_seq_len units long. When we trained our model, this was set to 75.\n\n```python\nlayer = Embedding(vocab_size, 64, input_length=max_seq_len)(inputs)\n```\n\nNext up, we have the Embedding layer. We could get into a really technical discussion about what this really does, but you can think of it as a layer that helps the neural network to learn semantic relationships between inputs.\n\n![credit: Rutger Ruizendaal, 2017](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3010/0*YOZ_CfmtgpUbJ9BD)*credit: Rutger Ruizendaal, 2017*\n\nEssentially, it embeds tokens in a higher dimension vector space, where distance between tokens represents its similarity.\n\n```python\nlayer = LSTM(64, return_sequences = True)(layer)\n```\n\nNow, we get into the meat of the neural network: the LSTM layer. As stated before, these LSTM networks are really good at modelling time series data like language. In this case, our LSTM network has 64 hidden units per cell, and that we’d like to pass these hidden states to the next layer. If you’d like to learn more about the inner workings of the LSTM model, theres a really good resource [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/illustrated-guide-to-lstms-and-gru-s-a-step-by-step-explanation-44e9eb85bf21)!\n\n```python\nlayer = Dropout(0.5)(layer)\n```\n\nNext, you’ll notice there are a few Dropout layers. These layers help to prevent overfitting by randomly killing off connections between the two layers (a sort of regularization). This makes sure neurons aren’t just “memorizing” the input data. This is especially important because our dataset is relatively small (~2000 observations even after augmentation), so making sure that our machine learning model can generalize outside of this limited dataset is really important.\n\n```python\nlayer = LSTM(64)(layer)\n```\n\nWe have yet another LSTM layer! By having these two chained right after each other, the first layer can pass all the values of all of its hidden states to the second layer, effectively allowing a sort of ‘deeper’ neural network.\n\n![credit: Jianjing Zhang 2018](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*0BRdnA5sJBYbaeR9)*credit: Jianjing Zhang 2018*\n\nThis deep LSTM allows our network to learn more abstract concepts, making them well suited for natural language tasks.\n\n```python\nlayer = Dense(256, name='FC1')(layer)\n```\n\nNext, we have something called a Fully Connected layer, or a Dense layer. In a dense layer, each of the input neurons is connected to every output neuron. This kind of ‘glue’ layer helps the network to pick out and discriminate feature output by our previous LSTM layer.\n\n```python\nlayer = Dense(1, name='out_layer')(layer)\nlayer = Activation('sigmoid')(layer)\n```\n\nSimilarly, we have one final Dense layer that ‘compresses’ all of the hidden units down to one neuron. However, we want the output value of this neuron to be how confident from a scale of 0 to 1 it is that the intent is valid. We do this by applying something called an activation function.\n\n![A sigmoid activation function](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*kdowh3GOGOUvGBr0)\n\nIn this case, the particular function we chose is the sigmoid activation function, which looks something like the above.\n\n### Model Overview\n\nPhew, finally got through everything! After putting it all together, we end up with a network that looks something like this:\n\n```python\n# 75 max_seq_len\n# 1000 tokenizer_vocab_size\nmodel = net.RNN(75, 1000) \nmodel.summary()\n\n# _________________________________________________________________\n# Layer (type)                 Output Shape              Param #   \n# =================================================================\n# inputs (InputLayer)          (None, 75)                0         \n# _________________________________________________________________\n# embedding_1 (Embedding)      (None, 75, 64)            64000     \n# _________________________________________________________________\n# lstm_1 (LSTM)                (None, 75, 64)            33024     \n# _________________________________________________________________\n# dropout_1 (Dropout)          (None, 75, 64)            0         \n# _________________________________________________________________\n# lstm_2 (LSTM)                (None, 64)                33024     \n# _________________________________________________________________\n# FC1 (Dense)                  (None, 256)               16640     \n# _________________________________________________________________\n# dropout_2 (Dropout)          (None, 256)               0         \n# _________________________________________________________________\n# out_layer (Dense)            (None, 1)                 257       \n# _________________________________________________________________\n# activation_1 (Activation)    (None, 1)                 0         \n# =================================================================\n# Total params: 146,945\n# Trainable params: 146,945\n# Non-trainable params: 0\n# _________________________________________________________________\n```\n\nTheres a grand total of 150,000 different trainable knobs and parameters in our neural network!\n\n## Training pipeline\n\nSo, how does the data we got earlier play a role in helping our machine learning model learn and improve?\n\nThe first component is the **loss function.** This component tells the neural network how ‘correct’ its prediction was. In this model, we will use something called [binary cross entropy](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-binary-cross-entropy-log-loss-a-visual-explanation-a3ac6025181a), which is basically a fancy word for log-based error. If the true label is 1, we can then show what the log-loss would be for some given prediction probability.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*8rd4ho_3Y6zrtra-.png)\n\nNext, we need to pick an **optimizer**. This component tells the neural network how to change its parameters to improve or ‘optimize’ itself. In this model, we chose to use an optimizer called [RMSProp](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-rmsprop-faster-neural-network-learning-62e116fcf29a) with a learning rate of 1e-3 . We aren’t going to cover all the technical details of this optimizer in this blog post, but just know that it is a very fast and effective optimizer.\n\n![RMSProp(black) vs a bunch of other optimizers. credit: Vitaly Bushaev](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*HZM5XJ-quu276w39.gif)*RMSProp(black) vs a bunch of other optimizers. credit: Vitaly Bushaev*\n\nOne important hyperparameter we choose is the **train-test split.** In data science and machine learning, we typically withhold part of our data and set it aside as a **test set**. The rest of the data will be considered the **training set.** When training the model, we never feed it the test set. As a result, we can use the test set as a metric to see how well it would perform on real-world, unseen data. In our training, we used a train-test split of 20%.\n\nAnother important hyperparameter that we can choose is the **mini-batch size**. The mini-batch size determines how many training examples we feed the machine learning model before updating its parameters. A smaller mini-batch means that we get more frequent updates to the parameters, but it also runs the risk of having outliers that may cause a bad gradient update. A large mini-batch means that we get a more accurate gradient update but it also takes longer. A similar concept is *sample size* in statistics. We could pick a larger sample to get a better estimate of the overall population, but it is often more expensive to do so. A smaller sample might contain outliers and thus be less robust of an estimate of the overall population, but it very easy to do. So, there’s this tradeoff between accuracy and speed. We found that a good balance between these was a mini-batch size of 128.\n\nWe then trained our neural network over 10 epochs. A single epoch is one iteration over the entire dataset. If we train it for too many epochs, you run the risk of overfitting (memorizing the training data), but we don’t train it enough, we run the risk of not discovering a better model. One thing we can do it minimize this problem is through the use of cross-validation, which is a technique that lets us ‘test’ on portions of the training set. Essentially, at each iteration during training, we withhold a portion of the training set and use it as a sort of ‘validation’.\n\n![credit: Raheel Shaikh](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*6XoMgZUd3SxXgqBj.png)*credit: Raheel Shaikh*\n\nBy seeing when this validation accuracy goes down, we can get a pretty good idea of when our model begins to overfit on our data, and stop the training before this happens. In training our model, we will use 5-fold [cross-validation](https://towardsdatascience.com/cross-validation-explained-evaluating-estimator-performance-e51e5430ff85).\n\nAfter all of this, we end with a training accuracy of 93.60% and test accuracy of 85.95%. Not bad at all!\n\n## Serving the model\n\nGreat! So now we have a trained model. Can we put that in the Chrome extension now? Not quite yet…\n\nOur model was written and trained with Keras (a Python Deep Learning library). Our Chrome extension is written in TypeScript. How do we get these two to work together?\n\nLuckily for us, Tensorflow.js exists! This library allows us to run Tensorflow models from within JavaScript. Tensorflow has released a script that lets us to convert a Keras model into something that Tensorflow.js understands, so we can run that to convert our models.\n\nHowever, we can’t just directly plug-and-play. You may remember that we did all of that data preprocessing before we trained our model. Tensorflow.js doesn’t have any of this built in, so we made our own implementation of it. You can check it out [here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/reflect-chrome/blob/master/src/nn.ts).\n\nWe’ll leave all the technical code out (if you’re interested, feel free to peek around the source code!), but we’ve abstracted it enough that classifying an intent is a breeze.\n\n```typescript\n// declared somewhere earlier\nconst model: nn.IntentClassifier = new nn.IntentClassifier(\"acc85.95\"); // name of converted model\n\n// send to nlp model for prediction\nconst valid: boolean = await model.predict(intent);\nif (valid) {\n    // let through\n} else {\n    // block page\n}\n```\n\n## Future improvement\n\n### Possible models\n\nWe have thought about using something more established and complex like [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) and retraining it on our dataset, however then comes the problem of runtime and memory usage.\n\nBERT is a huge model. If you thought 150 thousand parameters was a lot, wait till you see BERT’s 110 *million* parameters. This bad boy takes a few hundred times longer and many times more memory than our current model. While yes BERT may perform really well, we just don’t think it has a place inside of a Chrome extension.\n\nOur model is decently robust as it is, especially considering the entire model is \u003c2MB and takes less than 200ms to run in browser. For now, we will stick with lightweight models, but we may switch if we find a better match in the future :)\n\n### Misclassifications\n\nOf course, this algorithm isn’t perfect. It does have a lot of flaws and weaknesses that we find every day, and we’re working to fix those! If there are any misclassifications that you find in the algorithm, we love to hear about it on our feedback form: [https://forms.gle/ctypb6FmDT9RQqjv6](https://forms.gle/ctypb6FmDT9RQqjv6).\n\n## Closing\n\nThis NLP model is at the core of reflect. It is this model’s goal to predict whether user intents are valid or not. As a result, we need to make sure this algorithm is accurate, fast, and lightweight. Hopefully, through this blog post, you’ve learned a little about how we went about building a model to fulfill those requirements.\n\nLearn more about us on our website! ✨ [http://getreflect.app/](http://getreflect.app/)\n\nIf you have any further questions about reflect or this NLP model, feel free to shoot us an email at hello@getreflect.app","title":"reflect: NLP Model Explained"},"/templates/post":{"content":"---\ntitle: \"{{title}}\"\ndate: {{date}}\n---\n\n\n","title":"{{title}}"},"/thoughts/a-new-darpa":{"content":"---\ntitle: \"A new DARPA\"\ndate: 2021-08-01T22:10:54-04:00\n---\n\n\u003e Great hackers tend to clump together (PG, 2004)\n\nMoney is power.

The Steam Engine\n2. Electricity Grid\n3. Automobile\n\nConstant theme of Doctoroff is that of constant [acceleration](thoughts/acceleration.md) of innovation.\n\n### 'New Cities'\nIs it possible to build 'smart cities' tabula rasa?\n\nA sort of [Collingridge problem](thoughts/catch22.md) where they are constantly developing and \"versioning\" much like a software product in an agile process.\n\nDoes this only appeal to us because of the recent obsession of [computation](thoughts/computability.md) as a metaphor?\n\n### Cities as information centres\nNot only for transmitting information within a generation (breadth-wise) but also between generations (depth-wise)\n\n\u003e \"By means of its storage facilities (buildings, vaults, archives, monuments, tablets, books), the city became capable of transmitting a complex culture from generation to generation, for it marshaled together not only the physical means but the human agents needed to pass on and enlarge this heritage.\"\n\n\"What are the non-textual, un-recordable forms of cultural memory? These questions are especially relevant for marginalized populations, indigenous cultures, and developing nations.\" Especially related to [labels and quantization](thoughts/labels-and-quantization.md), how does always labeling and quantizing our data affect these forms of information? These forms cannot be reduced to 'information' nor can they be 'processed' easily within our digital systems. \"Yet they are vital urban intelligences that live within bodies, minds, and communities.\"\n\n### Computational Metaphors\nHistorically, we've analogized the brain (and the city) to technologies of our time. For example, we've compared the brain to \"lumps of clay infused with spirits, as hydraulic or electro-chemical systems, as automata.\"\n\n\u003e The _brain as computer_ is just the latest link in a long chain of metaphors that powerfully shape scientific endeavor in their own images.\n\n## Event Notes\n- So much of how we interact with cities is through a computer; how can we reclaim cities for the people within them as people instead of just as data? What have cities lost in the transition to a data governed model\n\t- How we define [computation](thoughts/computability.md) matters a lot\n\t- Definitely something is lost in this 'generalization' of people as data\n\t- A lot of 'messiness' in history (e.g. *why* people were evicted, etc.) especially in *embodied knowledge*\n\t- Let's think about what **can't** be digitized and be put on a dashboard\n\t- Technosolutionism in governing from just a quantized dashboard where the *people responsible for making the decisions are so abstracted away from the actual problems that they need to solve*\n- What are potential solutions to this overly [quantized](thoughts/labels-and-quantization.md) technosolutionist approach?

New buildings need to be designed with the expectation that they will evolve, because they usually outlive their initial use. Even if a building does not change its use (e.g. it remains the same university department), the needs of its users will change and the building will need to adapt. This should be done, for example, by making sure that changing the space layout in the building is possible without changing the structure.\n\n## XAI systems\nIn the last case (organized complexity and non-repetitive digital systems), the complexity of the problem cannot be reduced - we need to consider a large number of interacting processes or components. At the same time, all of them are equally important and play an important role in some aspect of the system. As Jane Jacobs puts it, the large number of interrelated variables form an organic whole. This is the end result of [emergent-behaviour](/thoughts/emergent-behaviour)\n\n## Maintainability\n[creation-vs-maintenance](/thoughts/creation-vs-maintenance)\nAlmost no buildings adapt well. They're designed not to adapt; also budgeted and financed not to, constructed not to, administered not to, maintained not to, regulated and taxed not to, even remodelled not to. But all buildings (...) adapt anyway, however poorly, because the usages in and around them are changing constantly.\n\nOpen-closed principle\n\nHow do we build software so that it gradually and gracefully degrades rather than abruptly stops working?\nJust like software systems, any building built using any kind of materials requires some maintenance over time. And just like with software systems, building owners are often bad at performing the necessary maintenance.\n\nThe idea of chaos engineering is perhaps a first step in this direction.\n\n\nRebuilding the shrine https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ise_Grand_Shrine -\u003e retaining knowledge through constant revision\n\nvernacular design restricts the scope of the problem by limiting architectural ideas to what is typically used in the local context. This reduces the design task and allows the builder to focus on skilful solutions to specific problems rather than at reinventing forms.

More generally, they are both names for structures of sets.\n\n\u003e For the human mind, the tree is the easiest vehicle for complex thoughts. But the city is not, cannot and must not be a tree. The city is a receptacle for life. If the receptacle severs the overlap of the strands of life within it, because it is a tree, it will be like a bowl full of razor blades on edge, ready to cut up whatever is entrusted to it. In such a receptacle life will be cut to pieces. If we make cities which are trees, they will cut our life within to pieces.\n\n## Urban Planning\n[urban-planning](/thoughts/urban-planning)\nColumbia, Maryland → Neighbourhoods, in clusters of five, form 'villages'. Transportation joins the villages into a new town. The organization is a tree.\n\nHilberseimer's book The Nature of Cities → He describes the fact that certain Roman towns had their origin as military camps. The symbol is apt, for, of course, the organization of the army was designed precisely in order to create discipline and rigidity.\n\n\n## Abolish hierarchies\nWhenever we have a tree structure, it means that within this structure no piece of any unit is ever connected to other units, except through the its parent (meaning the unit as a whole)\n\nDoes power always need to function top down?\n\n\u003e \"The enormity of this restriction is difficult to grasp. It is a little as though the members of a family were not free to make friends outside the family, except when the family as a whole made a friendship.\"\n\n## Why graphs are hard to visualize\nThe example the article used was to try and an orange, a watermelon, a football and a tennis ball. How will you keep them in your mind, in your mind's eye? However you do it, you will do it by grouping them. Maybe two fruits and two sports balls together. In doing so, you construct a tree structure. Maybe you group it by size, two small spheres and two large spheres. This constructs another tree. But try as hard as you like, two trees combined form a semilattice. It is very difficult to hold a semilattice in your head.\n\nMaybe this is where tools like knowledge graphs come in. Allow us to better visually explore these graph relations and allow us to capture more complex relations in things\n\nRegular note taking like Notion is hierarchical and linear → its a tree\nGraph representations like Roam Research, Obsidian allow us to make non-obvious non-hierarchical connections between concepts\n\nCurious if we can apply graph visualization approaches to [social media](/thoughts/social-graphs)?\n","title":"A City is not a Tree"},"/thoughts/articles/ghost-work":{"content":"---\ntitle: \"Ghost Work\"\ndate: 2021-08-06T12:17:07-04:00\n---\n","title":"Ghost Work"},"/thoughts/articles/on-idolization":{"content":"---\ntitle: \"On Idolization\"\ndate: 2021-06-23T23:36:57-04:00\n---\n\nhttps://blog.matthewwang.me/life/concise21/2021/03/01/on-idolization.html\n\n\"I struggled with this significantly in high school.

Is this a fair analogy to make? Especially when it doesn't really make sense to apply the 1-2 week sprint concepts to cities which intuitively span much larger timespans. Wonder how well the 'move fast break things' attitude transfers.\n\nThoughts on putting a whole city on the blockchain using a [DAO](thoughts/dao.md)? Turns out this is [already a thing.](https://city.mirror.xyz/fpjVcNlEkW6md2aDgoc6YVXbaGquNop3AJnOyQSurbw)\n\n## Maps\nMapping as a way to \"hold governments accountable … fill gaps when infrastructural and municipal services are fragmented … [and] make visible social and political processes and events that might be otherwise hidden or overlooked.\" (from Crowdsourcing, Constructing, and Collaborating: Methods and Social Impacts of Mapping the World Today)\n\nMore on participatory mapping and politics: [Mapping Politics in/of the Modern City: Cartography as Representation](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/296431763_Mapping_Politics_inof_the_City_Cartography_as_representation)\n\n'Participation' as public performance to 'signal' democratic processes without providing the real thing.\n\nMapwashing: \"a disingenuous use of maps, apps, and other tools of participatory planning\"\n\n## Responsiveness\n\u003e If urban design can be automated, if cities can be made responsive to real-time data collected from environments and inhabitants without their explicit consent, how meaningful is our participation?\n\nSidewalk also proposes creating more responsive public [infrastructure](thoughts/infrastructure.md) (e.g. benches, stormwater pipes, power grids, etc.) which collect data continuously and make 'smart' decisions. No opt-in or out process for this type of data collection, no consent.\n\nCurious if this is related to the move towards [real-time content](thoughts/ephemereal-content.md)\n\nHow much of this can be attributed to the Silicon Value ethic of \"move fast and break things\"? It feels like Sidewalk is extrapolating too much (trying to pull short feedback loops from naturally long timescales of city which operates on multi-year long scales).\n\nIs there a relationship between iteration cycle length and potential impact? Software people are used to iterating quickly without having consequence for each marginal build or project. Not the same case with cities where each change affects real people and there's no real 'staging' or 'development' area (see [Collingridge Dilemma](thoughts/catch22.md))\n\n## Humanistic Design\nIs creating people-first cities that are not driven by [techno-solutionism](thoughts/books/fctc.md) possible? How do we legitimately involve people in the creation of these cities?\n\n\"Do we need a commercial app to do what a robust, public democratic process should do?\" one quote reads. Or is rather than these democratic processes are failing so we look to alternatives?\n\nSidewalk feels very much talking into the void and talking to the org, not much talking with each other, no discussion groups. Yes, process and documentation matter, but if there's no input into this [feedback loop](thoughts/feedback-loops.md), the ideas are just self-reinforcing in an echo chamber. The problem is that large corporations like Alphabet present already-fleshed-out ideas with little room for debate so that 'conversations' and 'feedback' are largely performative.\n\nThe use of \"cheerful minimalism to mask the insidiousness of multinational tech corporations with friendliness and approachability,\" feels very similar to the weird vibe of the [signature corporate art style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFb7BOI_QFc) and why it feels so fake\n\nFrom Jasmine: With software, you can **find** product market fit, ignore edge cases and people who won't make you money, etc. But with cities, you are democratically obligated to build for everyone (or at least the majority)\n\n## Labels and Quantization\nSidewalk feels like a city trying to [label and quantize everything](thoughts/labels-and-quantization.md)\n\n\u003e Participants are obliged to transform complex spatial phenomena into machine-readable points, lines, and areas, adopting a logic defined by Euro-American geopolitics, settler colonialism, and property relations.\n\n[These maps and markers], while useful and actionable, tended to \"reduce complex life stories and neighborhood histories to 'dots on a map.'\"\n\nData as [digital desire paths?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire_path) Not sure how I feel about 'anonymized' or 'de-contextualized' data, stripping down and de-contextualizing opinions (e.g. post-it notes) removes important context and nuance.\n\n","title":"Post-It Note City"},"/thoughts/articles/pseudonymous-web":{"content":"---\ntitle: \"Pseudonymous Web\"\ndate: 2021-06-17T00:57:26-04:00\n---\n\n\u003e \"Despite my suburban liberal upbringing in Canada, on VRChat, I have listened to people who want gun rights, who refuse vaccination, and who reject taxation.

Is there any way we can construct fully [virtual worlds](thoughts/virtual-worlds) not tethered to reality? I'm not sure we can.\n\n\"In real life and on Facebook, you’re always signaling information about yourself which may not have anything to do with the context you’re in.\" -\u003e [framing](/posts/framing)\n\nThe paper introduces the comparison between a crutch and a shoe. Whereas a shoe can help you run faster, a crutch is designed to support you when you can’t walk normally, to get you as close as possible. A crutch will never help you run faster; it’s just an imitative substitute when the real thing isn’t available. In this sense, Facebook’s social graph is a crutch that imitates real-world relationships. Platforms which 1) require or encourage using your real identity or 2) rely on existing social graphs (contacts, classmates, mutuals) merely imitate “being there.” By mirroring the real world, platforms like Facebook are ultimately limited by the very physical connections they seek to transcend.\n\nTogether, these platforms form digitally native social graphs based on what people choose to emphasize about themselves, rather than on legal identity or physical proximity. These social graphs are difficult to create on identity-based platforms, as well as in real life, and are the result of meaningful connections between people who otherwise would never have met.\n\n## Decentralized Identities\n[Source](https://g.mirror.xyz/17-QuzdJJ0n-WGtuFiSXpH13-F3XCBgiPYCRtKANwc8)\n\nIs it possible to have pseudonymous identities in decentralized [web3](toc/web3.md) systems?

Rel: [knowledge distillation](thoughts/knowledge-distillation.md)\n\nThinking about understanding knowledge as climbing a mountain. Everytime novel work happens, the mountain gets a little bit taller.\n\n\u003e Mathematics is a striking example of this. For centuries, countless minds have climbed the mountain range of mathematics and laid new boulders at the top. Over time, different peaks formed, built on top of particularly beautiful results. Now the peaks of mathematics are so numerous and steep that no person can climb them all.\n\nYes, the climb is hard but it could be easier. Let's build staircases for the mountains.\n\n## Debt in research\n* Poor exposition -\u003e no good explanation of ideas and concepts\n* Undigested ideas -\u003e it takes effort to polish ideas, developing the right analogies, language, and ways of thinking\n* Bad abstractions and notation -\u003e abstractions and notation are the user interface of research. To have bad notation is to have bad ways to interact with the underlying knowledge\n* Noise -\u003e there's *too* much new progress being made each day. How do we choose what to focus on?\n\nNot just about poorly explained ideas, but rather the lack of ideas being digested and worked through in public (communal messiness of thought). How can we create better abstractions, notations, and visualizations to improve how we interact and interface with ideas?\n\n\u003e Part of thinking is having a conversation with ourselves.\n\n## Interpretive Labour\nThere is a tradeoff between energy put into explaining an idea, and the energy needed to understand it. This energy differential is called 'interpretive labour'\n\nMost research is one-to-many, where there are a lot more people trying to understand a subject than explaining it. As a result, the quality of explanations have an **outsized impact** for the better.\n\n![Interpretive Labour Multiplier](https://distill.pub/2017/research-debt/assets/publish-one-many-crop.jpg)\n\nCost of understanding increases when there are more source to try to understand. This may be why people specialize so that there is less noise. Related: [group limits](thoughts/group-limits.md)\n\n## Distillation\n\"Distillation is also hard. It’s tempting to think of explaining an idea as just putting a layer of polish on it, but good explanations often involve transforming the idea. This kind of refinement of an idea can take just as much effort and deep understanding as the initial discovery.\"\n\nSo who should distill knowledge?\n* Needs to be more than one person: too much knowledge to polish every idea from scratch\n* Cannot be less skilled non-experts: refining and explaining ideas requires creativity and deep understanding\n\nIs distillation a form of [maintenance](thoughts/creation-vs-maintenance.md)?\n\n### Where are the Distillers?\nThe research distiller is an integral role for a healthy research community, yet almost no one is filling it right now.\n\nIs it because people want their work to look hard?

If so, how do we decide what good is in a maximally beneficial way? Utilitarianist approach of maximizing everyone's utility function? Related to thoughts in [The Ones Who Walk From Omelas](thoughts/articles/the-ones-who-walk-from-omelas.md)\n\nA utopia implies perfection and thus no feedback. ML models think they live in a perfect world unless told otherwise.\n\n## 'Truth' and Feedback Loops\n\"Absurdity follows when algorithmic systems deny the people they mistreat the status to lodge complaints, let alone the power to repair, resist, or escape the world that these systems create.\" How do [feedback loops](thoughts/feedback-loops.md) play into these systems? Is it possible to create good human-in-the-loop ML?\n\n\"Absurdity and tragedy tend to manifest when bureaucratic imaginations diverge from reality and when people can't override the delusions baked into those imaginations\" It's dangerous when a single source dictates the truth.\n\nBut when the institution *does* wield power and people can't just leave anymore, these institutions can (and do) get more and more detached from the lives and needs of people. Those bureaucracies construct their own worlds where everything gets \"rationalized\" in simplified, reductive language.\n\n\"People talk about \"debiasing\" data and reviewing code before a model is trained and deployed.\nWhat I'm saying is that even if you've done everything right, if you don't pay attention to the power dynamics as they unfold and play out, the system out in the world is going to drift further and further away from reality.\"\n\nSystemized classification and quantification of the world acts as an interpretive and transformational force. In other words, [labels and quantization](thoughts/labels-and-quantization.md) change the world.\n\nWhy monopolies (over data and power) are bad: bureaucracies with no power self-correct (or be corrected) -\u003e they have no place in a world where people can freely walk away or reject the bureaucracy's nonsense (give feedback)\n\n## Abridged Maps\nAbridged maps as [potemkin villages](posts/ai-systems.md), producing a simplified yet inaccurate view of the world. It's not necessarily wrong to create 'abridged maps', the problem comes when projecting the map onto the world to try and create change.\n\n\"When modelers and designgers of influential systems use these maps as guides to substantially transform the world, the abridgements and the omissions they make become targets of erasure.\"\n\n\"In the process of training a model, the algorithm creates its own world -- it generates its own sort of utopia where things are clear and calculable. That system imposes its model upon the world, judging and punishing people who don't fit the model that the algorithm produced in the interest of some ostensibily objective goal that designers insist is better than decisions humans make in some or many ways.\"\n\nThese systems become more actively dangerous when they go from \"making sense of the world\" to \"making the world make sense\"\n\nThere's no dataset in the world that adequately conveys white supremacy, or slavery, or colonialism.\nSo at best these systems generate a facsimile of a world with the shadows of history cast on the ground\nskewed, flattened, and always lacking depth that only living these experiences can bring.

Mostly the result of the Cold War and the military-industrial complex and the power of Stanford -- these two were not completely separate.\n\nA lot of military funding went to the west (and to California and thus Stanford). Big result of Fred Terman (Dean of Engineering at the time): \"let’s remake Stanford so that it’s a perfect receptacle for this new money. We are a true Cold War university.\"\n\nThe military-industrial complex rose as a result of the Cold War, showing how a capitalist democracy can be 'triumphant' over more socialist policies. As a result, a lot of government money went to private defense contractors (think Lockheed). When the Space Race came along, a lot of that money went to places specializing in small, light, powerful devices (microchips, integrated circuirts), and this happened to be Silicon Valley.\n\nGovernment wasn't the sole reason this explosion happened, rather more of \"a customer, as a catalyst, as a kind of de facto venture capitalist at an early stage, when there was no commercial market for this stuff.\"\n\n\u003e To have such mobilization around this massive effort, you do probably need some sort of geopolitical catalyst. It’s hard for it to be purely commercial...  **That’s the thing that can catalyze people, government, and resources into doing these big things.**\n\nProblem is that this 'urgency' needs to be bipartisan -- this was very difficult when the Soviet Union was widely feared. As a result, anything even mildly centrist is perceived as socialist -\u003e https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULYWIDcUOY4\n\nAbstraction of the problem\n\nAntipathy that the Valley has had towards the government is kind of like, \"Well it doesn’t have anything to do with us, if they could stay as far away as possible it would be good.\" -- tech is political\n\n## Democratic Capitalism\nDemocratic capitalism and the ability for people to protest what their government is doing.\n\nHistorically, white-collar tech workers in industry have been very OK with whatever their companies are doing as long is it gives them a comfy lifestyle -- yet now people are starting to question it.\n\nSo much of the technical expertise that used to be distributed across industry and government is now just in industry. This inbalance means that government agencies like the Pentagon and CIA need to go to these big tech companies to build good tech.\n\n## Blue-sky Operations\n\"Spending money on moonshots, whether metaphorical or real, is kind of something only the government can do.\"\n\nExamples like DARPA, investing in technology that is at least a few decades away from being commercializable or being something the military could possibly use.\n\nPersonal Computing? Moving away from establishments having all the computing power and giving power back to the individual user. \"We’re going to create these devices, take them, and build computers of our own that are apart from this corporate military-industrial business.\"\n\nTo tell a company that is accountable to shareholders and quarterly earnings calls, “Okay, the moonshot’s on you guys,” is not so great.\n\n### Sandbox Model\n\"Throw a lot of money in its direction and get out of the way\" Create the sandbox, an incredible container with lots of resources in it, and allow creative people to play around in the sand and see what they develop. Naturally very incompatible with political traditions in other places.\n\n### Moonshot People and Immigration\nPeople like Andy Grove who later becomes the CEO of Intel, come into the country as teenage refugees from places like Hungary where the immigration officers probably thought he would be a 'drain on the system'.\n\nBut then you have winners of one generation picking the winners of the next, creating a very self-reinforcing [feedback loop](thoughts/feedback-loops.md).

How do we reconcile that at a global scale?","title":"Blockchain"},"/thoughts/books/design-justice":{"content":"---\ntitle: \"Design Justice\"\ndate: 2021-06-16T08:58:58-04:00\n---\n\n## Summary\nDesign Justice focuses not just on design in the visual and aesthetic sense, but also on the design of systems.\n\nTo quote from the book, \"Design justice rethinks design processes, centers people who are normally marginalized by design, and uses collaborative, creative practices to address the deepest challenges our communities face.\" The norms, values, and assumptions that are encoded and reproduced in the *design* of systems can be changed by rethinking our design processes.\n\nIn less than 400 short pages, Sasha Costanza-Chock covers a breadth of topics ranging from intersectionality, bias, and universal design to maintenance, design sites, and technosolutionism -- all through detailed case studies of real-world design practices and social movements.\n\nShe guides the reader into how the 'unmarked user' and universal design erases certain groups of people within the matrix of domination (through ableist, eurocentric, and classist assumptions) and refutes the argument that 'design by committee produces mediocrity.'\n\nDesign Justice is a book that invites us to \"center people who are too often marginalized by design\". More importantly, it urges us to work towards an equitable world for everyone: one which treats design justice not as a funnel that we use to limit ourselves to a minimal set of supposedly universal design choices, but rather as a prism through which to generate a far wider rainbow of possible choices, each better tailored to reflect the needs of a specific group of people.\n\n## Reflection\nDesign sites are valorized as places of learning, making, and building and the intersection of social movements and the counterculture. Why then, have they become increasingly corporate places of extraction of free labour?\n\nThis cooptation of hacker culture, hackathons as design sites in particular, by neoliberalism has been on the back of my mind ever since reading the chapter on design sites in Design Justice. As someone who first got their footing in computer science through hackathons, it pains me to see that this is the rep that hackathons have slowly gotten over time, moving from safe spaces for idea exploration to increasingly corporate, time-bound, events where hackers spin up apps to test company products in exchange for the slim chance of winning prizes and recognition.\n\nHackathons reshape precarious and unpaid work. Writing code and building apps for free becomes an extraordinary opportunity and a collective imagination for fictional expectations of innovation that benefits all. Do we so necessarily need to tie these rituals of play in building and tinkering to the recruiting and product testing pipeline for large corporations?\n\nAs a hackathon organizer, Design Justice has helped me to more actively think about what hackathons are trying to motivate. Having more of the tools to articulate and locate exactly why hackathons have felt increasingly corporate is the first step to reinstate hackathons as third spaces not as places of creation or competition, but as places of play and exploration.\n\n## Quotes\n### Defining Design Justice\nHow larger systems -- including norms, values, and assumptions -- are encoded in and reproduced through the design of sciotechnical systems. (artifacts have politics)\n\nDesign justice rethinks design processes, centers people who are normally marginalized by design, and uses collaborative, creative practices to address the deepest challenges our communities face\n\nDesign justice is a framework for analysis of how design distributes benefits and burdges between various groups of people.\n\nDesign (noun): A plan or scheme conceived in the mind and intended for subsequent execution; the preliminary conception of an idea that is to carried into effect by action; a project. (Oxford English Dictionary)\n\nTrue, everyone designs, but only certain kinds of design work are acknowledged, valorized, remunerated, and credited. Though all humans design, not everyone gets paid to do so.\n\n*Affordance* refers to \"the perceived and actual properties of the thing, primarily those fundamental properties that determine just how the thing could possibly be used.\" ... An object's affordances are never equally perceptible to all, and never equally available to all.\n\n### On Intersectionality\nBlock women workers at GM were told they had no legal grounds for a dscrimination case against their employer because antidiscrimination law only protected single-identity categories.\n\nThe concept of intersectionality provided the grounds for a long, slow paradigm shift that is still unfolding in the social sciences, in legal scholarship, and in other domains of research and practice.\n\nWhile there is rapidly growing interest in algorithmic bias audits, especially in the fairness, accoutnability, and transparency in machine learning (FAT*) community, most are single-axis: they look for a biased distribution of error rates only according to a single variable, such as race or gender.\n\nOne question about [intersectional approaches] is how many identity variables to include because each adds complexity (and, in many situations, time and cost) to audits.\n\n### Bias\nRelevant to [bias bug](/posts/bias-bug)\n\n3 groups of study\n1. Preexisting Bias: bias that exists in broader society, culture, and/or institutions is reproduced in the computer system, either intentionally or unintentionally, by systems developers.\n2. Technical Bias: some underlying aspect of the technology reproduces bias\n3. Emergent Bias: may not have been biased given its original context of use or original user base but comes to exhibit bias when the context shifts or when new users arrive\n\n### Universal Design\nUniversal Design (UD) as defined by Center for UD at North Carolina State University: The design of products and environment to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design\n\nAt least in the digital domain, adaptive design that enables personalization and flexible configuration of shared core objects, tools, platforms, and systems provides a path out of the tension between the diverse needs of individual users and the economic advantages of a large-scale user base.\n\nUniversalization erases difference and produces self-reinforcing spirals of exclusion, but personalized and culturally adawptive systems too often are deployed in ways that reinforce surveillance capitalism.\n\nWe should destabilize the underlying assumption that what is best for the majority of users is best for *all* users.\n\n### The Unmarked User\nDesigners most frequently assume that the unmarked user has access to several very powerful privileges, such as US citizenship, English language proficiency, access to broadband internet, a smartphone, a normatively abled body, and so on.\n\nFor broader reasons of structural inequality, the universe of real-world users falls within a limited range compared to the full breadth of *potential* users, then User-Centered Design reproduces exclusion by centering their needs.\n\n### Disability Simulation\nThese 'simulations' produce an unrealistic understanding of the life experience of disability for a number of reasons: the nondisabled person does not have the alternate skill sets developed by [disabled people], and thus overestimates the loss of function which disability presents, and is furthermore likely to think of able-normative solutions rather than solutions more attuned to a [disabled person's] life experience\n\nDisability simulation is discredited; lived experience is nontransferable. \"Don't start by building a new table; start by coming to the table\"\n\n### Dismantling Existing Systems\ni.e. what's wrong with colour blindness\n\n\"Under this new rhetoric of colour-blindness, equality means treating all individuals the same, regardless of differences they brought with them due to the effects of past discrimination or even discrimination in other venues\"\n\nNew Jim Code\nAlgorithmic decision systems based on historical data sets reinforce white seupremacy and discrimination even as they are positioned by their designers as \"fair\"\n\nRacial hierarchies can only be dismantled by actively antiracist systems design, not by pretending they don't exist.\n\nFar too often, user personas are created out of thin air by members of the design team, based on their own assumption or stereotypes about groups of people. When this happens, user personas are literally objectified assumptions about end users.\n\n### Maintenance\nRelevant to [maintenance](/thoughts/creation-vs-maintenance)\n\nCreating new vs maintaing old\nContributing to an existing project requires contacting and negotiating with the existing developers, maintainers, and community. Creating someething new produces attribution, credit, and visibility for its developers, whereas attribution, credit, and visibility for participating in an existing project must, at the very least, be shared.\n\nSupport maintenance, not just \"innovation.\" Significant resources are necessary to maintain and improve existing movement tech, but most focus is on the creation of new projects.\n\n\"Those of us working to promote universal access to clean water and sanitation must keep our eyes not just on the competition and prizes, but on the less glamorous work of encouraging adoption, usage, and maintenace\"\n\n### Technosolutionism/Technochauvinism\nNew technology will save us!!\n\nAn exclusionary and elitist understanding of what technology is and where it comes from and a lack of interest in preexisting, community-based desigbn practices.\n\n\"... where we are wholly dependent on a handful of extraordinarily gifted entrepreneurs to lead us out of the dark ages. This is a myth.\"\n\nFirst, it contains a somewhat masked normative assumption that \"technology adoption\" is always a good thing.\n\nNeoliberal, technocentric ideas about the city as a machine or as a software system waiting to be optimized have become increasingly prominent. Citizens should not be reduced to users through the lens of neoliberal governmentality.\n\nFirst consider what already works at the community level, and to steer students away from the pitfalls of tech solutionism and technochauvanism\n\n### Attention Economy\nRelevant to [attention economy](/thoughts/attention-economy)\n\nMediated visibility has become an important form of capital. Attention (time) is a scarce resource within late-stage informational capitalism, and its allocation has significant symbolic and material impacts.\n\n\"Design challenges\" in which dozens, sometimes hundreds, of people do free labour and submit ideas in hopes that they'll be the lucky one chosen to receive visibility, recognition, and possibly even compensation.\n\n### Design Sites\nTracing the cooptation of hacker culture by neoliberalism\n\nInvisibility of subaltern communites may also be strategic. Sometimes, they shield their practices and innovations from mainstream visibility to avoid incorporation and appropriation.\n\n\"Alternative spaces and forms of living provided interesting ideas could be milked and marketed. So certain structural features of these 'indie' movement outputs were suddenly highly acclaimed, applied, and copy-pasted into capitalist developing laboratories\"\nhttps://placesjournal.org/article/post-it-note-city/\n\nHackspaces in the European context, which they describe as originally being \"third spaces\" outside of the logic of both the communist state and the capitalist market. \n\nThe assumption that making sites \"open\" makes them inclusive, without specifically addressing race, class, gender, and/or disability dynamics, is common to many privileged design sites.\n\nMany who are active in these design sites feel themselves to be participants in *commons-based peer production,* or \"decentralized, collaborative, and non-proprietary; base on sharing resources and outputs among widely distributed, loosely connected individuals who cooperate with each other without relying on either market signals or managerial commands\"\n\nWithout intentional intervention, these spaces find it very difficult to fulfill even their own liberal democratic rhetoric because they end up dominated by white cis men and by middle-class people with free time and disposable income.\n\n#### Hackathons: The Bad\nRelevant to [reinventing hackathons](/thoughts/hackathons)\n\nHackathons are understood by corporate managers as potentially effective ways to identify new talent, and therefore as a possible mechanism in the tech sector hiring pipeline. \n\n\"Hackathons, time-bounded events where participants write computer code and build apps, have become a popular means of socializing tech students and workers to produce 'innovation' despite little promise of material reward... [they] reshape unpaid and precarious work as an extraordinary opportunity, a ritual of ecstatic labour, and a collective imaginary for fictional expectations of innovation that benefits all, a powerful strategy for manufacturing works' consent in the 'new' economy.\" (Sharon Zukin and Max Papadantonakis)\n\nHackathons provide excellent opportunities for the extraction of free labour.\n\nThe assumption that a \"hackathon for good\" will be successful if it produces a new app that can help \"solve\" a social problem runs deep.\n\nHackathons nearly always focus on problems and rarely build on existing community assets; and people thing hackathons can do things that they usually can't, such as solve big or even little problems, create new products overnight, or 'level the playing field' of innovation through meritocracy. \"A one day hack for homelessness takes away from the complexity of social justice issues. ... You can't just come up with an app and solve the world's problems\"\n\n\"Hackathon spaces cultivate a culture that marginalizes hackers with specific needs, including but not limited to women, people with disabilities, people with non-traditional backgrounds, and even individuals with specific dietary restrictions. By consistently ignoring the health, diet, and care needs of diverse attendees, along with needs based on skill, class, and gender identities, hackathons create an exclusive and hostile environment.\"\n\n#### Hackathons: The Good\nThey are often crucibles of intense and focused learning, making, problem-solving, communtiy building, and play.\n\n\"In the old days people used to form teams and rush in and try to fix things, without really even knowing what was broken ... it is no longer just a bunch of programmers in a room. There are now hackathons where actual community members are learning to code and interacting. ... Community members are also teaching programmers about the things they need to sustain and build for the future. That's a really good thing happening\"\n\nSuch hackathons push hackers to reflect on why they are doing the work they do, push for the ideas and welfare of marginalized communities in the tech sphere, and do so on the terms of their wellbeing and safety.\n\nOrganizers should pay attention to participants as whole human beings. For example, this means that it is important to consider food, bio breaks, accessible bathrooms that are friendly to all body types and genders, comfortable spaces to nap or relax, and decent lighting, etc.\n\n### Design Justice Pedagogies\n\"Critical pedagogy, where the role of the educator is to pose problems, create spaces for the collective development of critical consciousness, help to develop plans for action to make the world a better place, and develop a sense of agency among learners\"\n\n\"No one knows everything, but together we know a lot, if we listen to each other\"\n\nKey elements\n* Teach data science in a way that honours context, respects situated knowledge, and makes it clear that data is never \"raw\".\n* Emphasize the user of data to create shared meaning over individual mastery.\n* Teach data science that values not only reason, but ethics and emotions as well\n\n#### Constructionism\nPedagogical approach that centers context, situated knowledge, and learning by doing. Similar to the ideas in [Mindstorms](/thoughts/books/mindstorms)\n\nPapert rejected the banking method of education: educator transmits a piece of information to the learner's brain\n\nInstead, learning is *experiential*: it takes place through an active process where the learning develops the ability to modify or transform an object or idea.\n\nCore principles\n1. People do not get ideas, they make them\n2. People construct new knowledge with particular effectiveness when they are engaged in constructing personally meaningful products\n\n\"Instead, design justice pedagogies must support students to actively develop their own critical analysis of design, power, and liberation, in ways that connect with their own lived experience\"\n\nHowever, if resource constraints become an excuse to avoid examining the root of the problem area, then designers will almost always end up, at best, providing Band-Aids for deep wounds and, at word, actively serving existing power structures.\n\n### Critiques\n\"Design by commitee produces mediocrity\" or \"we don't want to end up with the lowest-common-denominator design!\"\n\nIt's true that design justice practitioners have to take care that critique does not become our primary activity; an overemphasis on testing, evaluation, and critique can indeed be ultimately disempowering. At the same time, explicit critique paired with alternative proposals can be very productive.\n\nDesign justice doesn't imply that we must somehow reduce our options to only those that satisfy all accessibility criteria for the most marginalized within the matrix of domination. It is not meant to be a *filter* that we use to eliminate most design possibilities from consideration because they fail an accessibility checklist. In fact, design justice as a framework is meant to do the opposite: to act not as a funnel that we use to limit ourselves to a minimal set of supposedly universal design choics, but rather as a prism through which to generate a far wider rainbow of possible choices, each better tailored to reflect the needs of a specific group of people.","title":"Design Justice"},"/thoughts/books/fctc":{"content":"---\ntitle: \"From Counterculture to Cyberculture\"\ndate: 2021-06-16T08:59:04-04:00\n---\n\n## Quotes\n### Digital Communalism\n\"Ubiquitous networked computing had arrived, and in its shiny array of interlinked devices, pundits, scholars, and investors alike saw the image of an ideal society: decentralized, egalitarian, harmonious, and free\"\n\n\"In *The Gutenberg Galaxy* McLuhan described the new age in tribal terms: electronic media had linked all of humanity into a single 'global vilage'\"\n\n\"Nor does the fact that individuals can come together by means of ocmputer networks necessarily require that their gatherings become 'virtual communities'\"\n\n\"Dyson and Barlow, as well as many other commentators at the time, saw the Internet serving as a rhetorical prototype for new, flexible, and mobile ways of working and living.\"\n\nTogether, the *Catalog* and the *Supplement* became textual forums within which a geographically dispersed collection of individuals and groups could come together, in text and sometimes pictures, and recognize each other as members of a single community.

The center of change must be the individual, acting with other likeminded individuals. This emphasis on local action echoes the notion of the individual's local role in maintaining universal systems.\"\n\nWEC seems to promote an incredibly individualistic approach; Indians must work with Indians, the Third World with the Third Wolrd, blacks with blacks, and so on. No group should count on help from any other... Such segregation might seem to conflict with the WEC's celebration of 'whole' systems. This seems to be an artifact of the fact that all members of the WEC were white and relatively young, iwth a high level of education and easy access to social and financial resources.\n\n\"The great machines of empire had been miniturized and turned over to individuals, and so transformed into tools with which individuals could improve their own lives.\"\n\n\"As a variety of economic sociologists have noted, the mid-1980s saw hierarchical firms in many industries and several nations reorganize themselves as project oriented networks.

Should be a universal system.\n-   War brought different people from different disciplines together and had a shared communication medium of code\n\n### What was the counterculture?\n\n-   People in 50s and 60s protesting because worried about being turned into information\n-   Two distinct movements (both are anti-bureaucracy, anti-big tech, anti-mass culture)\n    -   New Left (political)\n        -   Struggle\n        -   Leaders, Parties\n    -   New Communalists (internal consciousness, mindset)\n        -   Deeply anchored in the dreams of the cyberneticists\n        -   Technocrats of control via communication (banger)\n        -   Communes (literally in the name)\n-   Why were the 50's kids so enamoured with technology?\n    -   Kids of the counterculture\n    -   Keep the tech made from the way but throw away the culture of the time\n-   When you take away bureaucracy you don't get freedom but 'rule by cool' → disastrous for a democratic society\n\n### Did the New Left have any effect on Cyberculture?\n\n-   Folks on new left will say they did → Computers fulfilled agreement\n-   Communalists had more contribution in tech world\n-   Communes were disasters, didn't last long, living in California\n-   Computer industry was booming\n-   Stanford = hotbed of creative LSD ingestion (damn wtf)\n    -   reboot group trip when?\n-   Steward Brand in 1984 as an Apple Mac, create a society of consciousness\n    -   Mac (as a metaphor for tech) is the new LSD → ability to remove the importance of the physical self\n\n### How much of the shift was a result of WEC?

And children learn language by first learning their own (\"baby-talk\") dialects. So, when we think of microworlds as incubators for powerful ideas, we are trying to draw upon this effective strategy: We allow learners to learn the \"official\" physics by allowing them the freedom to invent many that will work in as many invented worlds.\n\nWhy there is no good answer to \"how do I learn CS\" \n\"I see Piaget as the theorist of learning without curriculum and the theorist of the kind of learning that happens without deliberate teaching... But 'teaching without curriculum' does not mean spontaneous, free-form classrooms or simply 'leaving the child alone.' It means supporting children as they build their own intellectual structures with materials drawn from the surrounding culture\"\nhttp://paulgraham.com/own.html\n    \"They'll handle the details. Indeed, they insist on it. For a project to feel like your own, you must have sufficient autonomy. You can't be working to order, or slowed down by bureaucracy.\"\n\n\n### Composition\nWhen knowledge can be broken up into \"mind-size bites,\" it is more communicable, more assimilable, more simply constructable.\n\n\"New commands, once defined, can be used to define others.\"\n\n### Computing as a medium/language\n\"Seymour saw the computer not just as a problem-solving tool but as an expressive medium. He believed that learning to program was analogous to learning to write, providing children with new ways of organizing and expressing their ideas.\"\n\nDoes language matter when programming?\n\"A programming language is like a natural, human language in that it favors certain metaphors, images, and ways of thinking. The language used strongly colors the computer culture\"\n\n### Microworlds and simplification\nNewton \"understood\" the universe by reducing whole planets to points that move according to a fixed set of laws of motion. Is this grasping the essence of the real world or hiding its complexities?\n\nrestricted microworlds give students the freedom to explore, without needing to ask for permission or reassurance from teachers\n\nIn school, false theories are no longer tolerated. Our educational system rejects the \"false theories\" of children, thereby rejecting the way children really learn.\n\nDanger of 'simplicity': [design-justice](/thoughts/books/design-justice)\n\"Imagine a suggestion that we invent a special language to help children learn to speak. This language would have a small vocabulary of just fifty words, but fifty words so well chosen that all ideas could be expressed using them. Would this language be easier to learn? Perhaps the vocabulary might be easy to learn, but the use of the vocabulary to express what one wanted to say would be so contorted that only the most motivated and brilliant children would learn to say more than 'hi'.\"\n\n### On mechanical thinking\nDiscovery cannot be a setup; invention cannot be scheduled\n\nPeople often fear that using computer models for people will lead to mechanical or linear thinking: They worry about people losing respect for their intuitions, sense of values, powers of judgement. They worry about instrumental reason becoming a model for good thinking. I take these fears seriously but do not see them as fears about computers themselves but rather as fears about hwo culture will assimilate the computer presence.\n\nRelevant to [AI systems](/posts/ai-systems)\nThe definition of artificial intelligence can be narrow or broad. In the narrow sense, AI is concerned with extending the capacity of machines to perform functions that would be considered intelligent if performed by people. Its goal is to construct machines, and, in doing so, it can be thought of as a branch of advanced engineering... In order to make a machine capable of learning, we have to probe deeply into the nature of learning. And from this kind of research comes the broader definition of artificial intelligence: that of cognitive science.\n\n\"The question to ask about the program is not whether it is right of wrong, but if it is fixable. If this way of looking at intellectual products were generalized to how the larger culture thinks about knowledge and its acquisition, we all might be less intimidated by our fears of 'being wrong.'\"\n\n### Multiple Realization\nRelated to [multiple-realization](/thoughts/multiple-realization)\n\nMen have always been interested in flying. Once upon a time, scientists determined to understand how birds fly. First they watched them, hoping to correlate the motion of a bird's wings with its upward movement. Then they proceeded to experiment and found that when its feathers were plucked, a bird could no longer fly. Having thus determined that feathers were the organ of flight, the scientists then focused their efforts on microscopic and ultramicroscopic investigation of feathers in order to discover the nature of their flight-giving power.\n\n\"You have no reason to suppose that airplanes and birds work the same way -- birds have no propellors, airplanes have no feathers\"\n\n\"If we had to base our opinions on observation of how poorly children learned French in American schools, we would have to conclude that most people were incapable of mastering it. But we know that all normal children would learn it easily if they lived in France.\"\n\nIn retrospect, we know that the road that led from nineteenth-century transportation was quite different. The invention of the automobile and the airplane did not come from a detailed study of how their predecessors, such as horse-drawn carriages, worked or did not work.\n\n### Logical consistency in systems\nThe conflicts are regulated and kept in check rather than \"resolved\" through the intervention of special agents no less simple-minded than the original ones. Their way of reconciling differences does not involve forcing the system into a logically consistent mold.\n\nOn brain being compartmentalized\nWe put our skills and heuristic strategies into a kind of tool box -- and while their interaction can, in the course of time, give rise to global changes, the act of learning is itself a *local* event.\n\n### Knowledge distillation\nOn the role of [knowledge distillers](thoughts/knowledge-distillation.md): \nThis problem goes deeper than a mere short supply of such people. The fact that in the past there was no role for such people has been cast into social and institutional concrete; now there is a role but there is no place for them.\n\nIt is a step toward a situation in which the line between learners and teachers can fade\n\nA stage of unconscious work, which might appear to the mathmatician as temporarily abondoning the task or leaving the problem to incubate, has to intervene... On the contrary, the problem has been turned over to a very active unconscious which relentlessly begins to combine the elements supplied to it by the \n\n### Misc\nOn self-correcting systems like bikes\n\"Thus learning to ride does not mean learning to balance, it means learning not to unbalance, learning not to interfere\"\n\nPart of the fun is sharing, posting graphics on the walls, modifying and experimenting with each other's work, and bringing the \"new\" products back to the original inventors.\n\nOn rejecting the false dichotomy of verbalizable versus nonverbalizable knowledge\n\"No knowledge is entirely reducible to words, and no knowledge is entirely ineffable\"\n\n\"As knowing how to use a computer becomes increasingly necessary to effective social and economic participation, the position of the underprivileged could worsen, and the computer could exacerbate existing class distinctions.\"\n\nOn the split between 'humanities' and 'science'\n\"It is self-perpetuating: The more the culture is divided, the more each side builds separation into its new growth\"\n\nThe printed page cannot capture either the product or the process: the serendipitous discoveries, the bugs, and the mathematical insights all require movement to be appreciated.","title":"Mindstorms"},"/thoughts/building-in-public":{"content":"---\ntitle: \"Building in Public\"\ndate: 2021-06-16T17:39:37-04:00\n---\n\n\"He who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but he also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important.\" — richard hamming\n\n[https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html)\n\ninvite distractions but get a better sense of the world","title":"Building in Public"},"/thoughts/catch22":{"content":"---\ntitle: \"Catch  22\"\ndate: 2021-05-25T11:28:29-04:00\n---\n\nIf a pilot is deemed insane, they don't have to fly.\nTo be deemed insane, a pilot must request to be evaluated.\nIf a pilot requests to be evaluated, this demonstrates that he must be sane.\nTherefore, no pilot can ever be deemed insane, and no pilot can get out of flying.\nparadoxical sitauation -\u003e catch-22\n\nno way to win\ndouble bind -\u003e a psychological predicament in which a person receives from a single source conflicting messages that allow no appropriate response to be made\n\n## Collingridge dilemma\nefforts to influence or control the further development of technology face a double-bind problem\nAn information problem: impacts cannot be easily predicted until the technology is extensively developed and widely used.\nA power problem: control or change is difficult when the technology has become entrenched.\n\n## Pacing Problem\nThe \"pacing problem\" refers to the notion that technological innovation is increasingly outpacing the ability of laws and regulations to keep up, first explained in Larry Downes' 2009 book The Laws of Disruption, in which he famously states that \"technology changes exponentially, but social, economic, and legal systems change incrementally\".","title":"Catch  22"},"/thoughts/climate-tech":{"content":"---\ntitle: \"Climate Tech\"\ndate: 2021-07-15T17:28:11-04:00\n---\n\nNot just about investing in carbon removal or carbon offsets also about investing in the [infrastructure](/thoughts/infrastructure) to make it possible. \n\n[The Land Ethic](https://www.cooperative-individualism.org/leopold-aldo_land-ethic-1949.pdf) simply enlarges the boundaries of the community to include soils, waters, plants, and animals, or collectively: the land.

They either\n1. don't offset the amount they were supposed to do\n2. bought gains that were quickly offset\n3. amount of carbon couldn't be measured accurately\n\nUltimately leading polluters to get off scott free while the planet still suffers. Is this still ok thought? As long as some trees are saved and foreign aid is going toward protecting forests\n\nCarbon offsets are just \"charismatic carbon\" -- they offer a feel-good story of environmental and social good without doing much\n\nOriginally was a compromise between European, American, and developing nations\n1. European leaders wanted to create policies to encourage industry to polute less\n2. Americans wanted flexibility\n3. Devloping nations (e.g. Brazil) wanted money to deal with climate change\n\nOn paper, this seemed perfect: if it cost too much to reduce emissions in one area, you could 'buy' the equivalent offset. This in theory could incentivize orgs to try and develop more green tech (e.g. solar plant in favour of a coal plant) in anticipation of carbon credit sales\n\nIn practice doesn't work super well\n1. Clean Development Mechanism: 85% of offsets had a 'low likelihood' of creating real impacts\n2. Join Implementation: 75%\n\nLeakage: protecting one patch of land could lead to deforestation somewhere else as loggers work to try and meet quotas\n\nPreserving land and trees is hard in any developing country is hard: the poverty and lack of infrastructure \"drives people to violate whatever protections are in place to plant crops or mine for gold or just have enough lumber to build their homes\"\n\n\u003e When a tree is destroyed, all the carbon accumulated over its lifetime is released back into the atmosphere.\n\nBut there's not a lot of incentive for local residents\n- Rubber sells for about 2 reais/kg (roughly enough for a cup of coffee) whereas a single cow is ~800 reais ($200)\n- Sustainable logging didn't pay enough\n- Government subsidies don't consider enough things\n\t- Digging fish ponds but they don't produce enough\n\t- Rubber-tapping tries but can't afford fertilizer for the poor Amazon soil\n\n\u003e “Cattle is a secure market. You can get a good income selling a calf, an ox,” Silva said.\n\n\u003e “Who is willing to rubber tap nowadays?” Brito said. “Nobody, practically nobody. We want an easier way to live.”\n\nGerrymandering but for trees? A lot of the offset calculations are based off of regional averages for carbon, projects can then take advantage of 'unusually high' concentration areas with certain types of trees to game the system and gain more credits than they should have.\n\nThis could actually benefit indigenous tribes because of their more conservative approach to logging -- in fact, offsets can enable tribes to reduce logging. However, \"some tribal members are [deeply uncomfortable](https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/how-carbon-trading-became-a-way-of-life-for-californias-yurok-tribe) with the idea of selling offsets to companies like this even if they are legitimate, fearing they’re effectively profiting from pollution.\"\n\n### Good Offsets?\n[Source](https://negative.sanctuary.computer/offsetting)\n\n1. Transparency: any individual credits can not be purchased more than once\n2. Permanence: credits should not be liable to be undone\n3. Additionality: by facilitating this activity, more carbon was drawn down than would have been\n4.

Its 'reduced cost' does not factor in long-term negative externalities like warming the ocean.\n\n\"Many of these solutions are readily available, but in a risk-averse industry, most companies have been reluctant to make wholesale change.\" This is largely due to the anonymity involved in the industry where even the federal government was unable to determine how much energy its own data centers consume.\n\n\u003e \"They don’t get a bonus for saving on the electric bill. They get a bonus for having the data center available 99.999 percent of the time.\"\n\nLow utilization can mean that the energy wasted is as much as 30x the amount of electricity used if it was at 100% utilization.\n\n## Company Initiatives\n### Stripe\nhttps://stripe.com/climate\n\ntldr; we need to develop new carbon removal tech, the ones we have right now are [unlikely to scale to well enough](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aabf9f) to tackle the problem as it stands right now\n\n\"Today, carbon removal solutions face a chicken-and-egg problem.

What does good/bad moderation look like? (posts/comments/membership)\n\nI think a key part of answering this is trying to define what role a community occupies. Is it just a collection of people gathering around a shared identity? Or is it supposed to be a platform for moderated idea discussion/generation? Or something else in between.\n\nThinking about this at the [infrastructure](/thoughts/infrastructure) level too, if a community's purpose is to serve as infrastructure so that it enables conversations, should infrastructure be regulated/enforced or something that should just play out naturally?\n\nBroadly defined, I see moderation as having two main categories: moderation of users and moderation of content. Moderation then, is to ensure that the set of values that is being conveyed by the users/content roughly aligns with that of the group/community.\n\nModeration of users involves regulating the *membership* of individuals within the community whereas moderation of content regulates what can/can't be said in the community.\n\nModeration gets problematic when it is used to target and discriminate against individuals becuase of personal relations or vendettas. I was thinking about also saying it becomes problematic when it discriminates against characteristics but I'm hesitant on this bit.

Surface properties\n4. Camera optics\n5. Sensor properties\n\n### Examples\n#### Reflection\nSurface reflection depends on viewing $(\\theta_v,\\phi_v)$ and illumination $(\\theta_i,\\phi_i)$ direction along with the Bidirectional Reflection Distribution Function: $BRDF(\\theta_v,\\phi_v,\\theta_i,\\phi_i) = \\frac{\\rho_d}{\\pi}$\n\nAll angles are spherical coordinates w.r.t. the normal line of the surface.\n\nA Lambertian (matte) surface is one which appears the same brightness from all directions. A mirror (specular) surface is one where all incident light is reflected in one direction $(\\theta_v,\\phi_v)=(\\theta_r,\\phi_r)$\n\n#### Cameras\n![Bare-sensor imaging](/thoughts/images/bare-sensor-imaging.png)*All scene points contribute to all sensor pixels*\n\nAs a result, the image is really blurry.\n\n![Pinhole camera](/thoughts/images/pinhole.png)*Pinhole camera*\n\nThe image here is flipped, but no longer blurry. Roughly, each scene point contributes to one sensor. Pinhole camera means you need to get the right size of pinhole. If the pinhole is too big, then many directions are averaged, blurring the image. If the pinhole is too small, then diffraction becomes a factor, also blurring the image.\n\nA few perspective 'tricks' arise out of the pinhole\n1. Size is inversely proportional to distance\n2. Parallel lines meet at a point (vanishing point on the horizon)\n\nSide note, pinhole cameras are really slow because only a small amount of light actually makes it through the pinhole. As a result, we have lenses\n\n#### Lenses\nThe role of a lens is to capture more light while preserving, as much as possible, the abstraction of an ideal pinhole camera, the thin lens equation\n\n$$\\frac{1}{z'} - \\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{1}{f}$$\n\nwhere $f$ is the focal point, $z'$ is the distance to the image plane, and $z$ is the distance to the object.\n\nFocal length can be thought of as the distance behind the lens where incoming rays parallel to the optical axis converge to a single point.\n\nDifferent effects can be explained using physics phenomena. Vignettes are simply light that reaches one lens but not the other in a compound lens. Chromatic aberration happens because the index of refraction depends on wavelength of the light so not all colours can be in equal focus.\n\nSimilarities with the human eye\n- pupil is analogous to the pinhole/aperture\n- retina is analogous to the film/digital sensor\n\n#### Weak Perspective\nOnly accurate when object is small/distant.

We denote a convolution with the $\\otimes$ symbol.\n\nIn general,\n1. Correlation: measures similarity between two signals. In our case, this would mean similarity between a filter and an image patch it is being applied to\n2. Convolution: measures the effect one signal has on another signal\n\nEach pixel in the output image is a linear combination of the central pixel and its neighbouring pixels in the original image. This results in $m^2 \\times n^2$ computations. When $m \\approx n$, then this is a $\\mathcal{O}(n^4)$\n\nLow pass filters filter out high frequences, high pass filters filter out low frequencies.\n\n### Properties of Linear Filters\n1. Superposition: distributive law applies to convolution. Let $F_1$ and $F_2$ be digital filters. Then $$(F_1 + F_2) \\otimes I(x,y) = F_1 \\otimes I(x,y) + F_2 \\otimes I(x,y)$$\n2. Scaling. Let $F$ be a digital filter and let $k$ be a scalar. $$(kF) \\otimes I(x,y) = F \\otimes (kI(x,y)) = k(F \\otimes I(x,y))$$\n3. Shift invariance: output is local (doesn't depend on absolute position in image)\n\n**Characterization Theorem**: Any operation is linear if it satisfies both superposition and scaling. Any linear, shift-invariant operation can be expressed as a convolution.\n\n#### Properties of Convolution\n1. Associative. $G \\otimes (F \\otimes I(x,y)) = (G \\otimes F) \\otimes I(x,y)$\n2. Symmetric. $(G \\otimes F) \\otimes I(x,y) = (F \\otimes G) \\otimes I(x,y)$\n\nCorrelation, on the other hand, is generally not associative.\n\nFor 1D Gaussians, we note $G_{\\sigma_1}(x) \\otimes G_{\\sigma_2}(x) = G_{\\sqrt{\\sigma_1^2 + \\sigma_2^2}}(x)$. Convolving with $G_\\sigma(x) \\otimes G_\\sigma(x) = G_{\\sqrt 2 \\sigma}(x)$\n\n### Boundary Effects\n1. Ignore these locations: make the computation undefined for the outsize $k$ rows/columns\n2. Pad with zeroes: return zero whenever of value of $I$ is required at some position outside the image\n3. Assume periodicity: wrap image around\n4. Reflect border\n\n### Pillbox\nA 2D pillbox is rotationally invariant but not separable\n\n$$f(x,y) = \\frac{1}{\\pi r^2}\n\\begin{cases} \n  1 \u0026 \\textrm{if} x^2 + y^2 \\leq r^2 \\\\\n  0 \u0026 \\textrm{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nAn efficient implementation would represent a 2D box filter as the sum of a 2D pillbox and some \"extra corner bits\"\n\n### Gaussian Filters\n- Box filter doesn't apply well for lens defocus. A circular pillbox is a much better model for defocus\n- Gaussian is a good general smoothing model\n  - for phenomena\n  - whenever the CLT applies\n\nGaussian filters are rotationally invariant.\n\nWe get $G_\\sigma(x,y) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sigma^2}\\exp^{-\\frac{x^2+y^2}{2\\sigma^2}}$ where $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation\n\nFor a 3x3, we then need to quantize and truncate it, evaluating $G_\\sigma(x,y)$ wherever in the filter. Increasing $\\sigma$ means more blur. Problem with 3x3 is that it truncates too much of the distribution (does not sum up to one), this can cause unintentional darkening.\n\nIn general, the Gaussian filter should capture $\\pm3\\sigma$ for $\\sigma = 1$ which gives us a 7x7 filter.\n\n#### Efficiency\nAs both the 2D box filter and 2D Gaussian filter are separable, it can be implemented as two 1D convolutions which convolve each row and then each column separately.\n\nA 2D filter is separable if it can be expressed as an outer product of two 1D filters\n\nA seperable 2D Gaussian only does $2m$ multiplications at each pixel (one for each 1D filter). Considering the image has $n \\times n$ pixels, then this is a $2m \\times n^2$ multiplications. Assuming $m \\approx n$, this is $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$\n\n#### Fourier Transform\nThe basic building block of the fourier transform is the periodic function.\n\n$$Asin(\\omega x + \\phi)$$\n\nwhere $A$ is the amplitude, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency and $\\phi$ is the phase. Fourier's claim was that you could add enough of these to get any periodic signal!\n\n### The Convolution Theorem\nLet $i'(x,y) = f(x,y) \\otimes i(x,y)$ be the convolution.\n\nThen, $\\mathcal{I}'(w_x,w_y) = \\mathcal{F}(w_x,w_y)\\mathcal{I}(w_x,w_y)$ which is just a simple element-wise multiplication after applying a Fourier transform to each.\n\nAt the expense of two Fourier transforms and one inverse Fourier transform, convolution can be reduced to (complex) multiplication. This speeds up the cost of FFT/IFFT for the image and filter to $\\mathcal{O}(n^2\\log n)$ and $\\mathcal{O}(m^2\\log m)$ respectively, dropping the total cost of convolution to $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$\n\n## Non-linear filters\n- Median Filter (take the median value of the pixels under the filter), effective at reducing certain kinds of noise, such as impulse noise ('salt and pepper' noise or 'shot' noise)\n- Bilateral Filter (edge-preserving filter). Effectively smooths out the image but keeps the sharp edges, good for denoising. Weights of neighbour at a spacial offset $(x,y)$ from the center pixel $I(X,Y)$ given by a product $\\exp^{-\\frac{x^2+y^2}{2\\sigma_d^2}}\\exp^{-\\frac{(I(X+x, Y+y) - I(X,Y))^2}{2\\sigma_r^2}}$. We call the first half of the product the *domain kernel* (which is essentially a Gaussian) and the second half the *range kernel* (which depends on location in the image).\n- ReLU. $x$ for all $x \u003e 0$, $0$ otherwise.\n\n## Sampling\nImages are a discrete (read: sampled) representation of a continuous world.\n\nAn image suggests a 2D surface which can be grayscale or colour. We note that in the continuous case that \n\n$i(x,y)$ is a real-valued function of real spatial variables, $x$ and $y$. It is bounded above and below, meaning $0 \\leq i(x,y) \\leq M$ where $M$ is the maximum brightness. It is bounded in extent, meaning that $x$ and $y$ do not span the entirety of the reals.\n\nImages can also be considered a function of time. Then, we write $i(x,y,t)$ where $t$ is the temporal variable. We can also explicitly state the dependence of brightness on wavelength explicit, $i(x,y,t,\\lambda)$ where $\\lambda$ is a spectral variable.\n\nWe denote the discrete image with a capital I as $I(x,y)$. So when we go from continuous to discrete, how do we sample?\n- Point sampling is useful for theoretical development\n- Area-based sampling occurs in practice\n\nWe also quantize the brightness into a finite number of equivalence classes. These values are called gray-levels\n\n$$I(x,y) \\implies \\lfloor \\frac{i(x,y)}{M} (2^n - 1) + 0.5\\rfloor$$\n\nTypically, $n=8$ giving us $0 \\leq n \\leq 256$\n\nIs it possible to recover $i(x,y)$ from $I(x,y)$? In the case when the continuous is equal to the discrete, this is possible (e.g. a completely flat image). However, if there is a discontinuouty that doesn't fall at a precise integer, we cannot recover the original continuous image.\n\nA bandlimit is the maximum *spatial frequency* of an image. The audio equivalent of this is audio frequency, the upper limit of human hearing is about 20kHz which is the human hearing bandlimit.\n\nAliasing is the idea that we don't have have enough samples to properly reconstruct the original signal so we construct a lower frequency (fidelity) version.\n\nWe can reduce aliasing artifacts by doing\n1. Oversampling: sample more than you think you need and average\n2. Smoothing before sampling: reduce image frequency\n\nThis creates funky patterns on discrete images called moire patterns. This happens in film too (temporal aliasing), this is why wheels sometimes look like they go backwards.\n\nThe fundamental result (Sampling Theorem): For bandlimited signals, if you sample regularly at or above twice the maximum frequency (called the Nyquist Rate), then you can reconstruct the original signal exactly.\n\n- Oversampling: nothing bad happens! Just wasted bits.\n- Undersampling: things are missing and there are artifacts (things that shouldn't be there)\n\n### Shrinking Images\nWe can't shrink an image simply by taking every second pixel\n\nArtifacts will appear:\n1. Small phenomena can look bigger (moire patterns in checkerboards and striped shirts)\n2. Fast phenomena can look slower (wagon wheels rolling the wrong way)\n\nWe can sub-sample by using Gaussian pre-filtering (Gaussian blur first then throw away every other column/row). Practically, for ever image reduction of a half, smooth by $\\sigma = 1$\n\n## Colour Filter Arrays\nOne implementation of photo sensors \n1. Microlens\n2. [optional] Colour Filter (what spectral sensitivity functions do we use for each colour? Human colour sensitivity differs between colours as well)\n3. Photodiode\n4. Potential well\n\nTwo design choices to make when designing CFAs:\n1. What spectral sensitivity functions (SSFs) do we use for each colour filter?\n2. How do we spatially arrange filters to create the best mosaic for CFAs?\n\nRAW Bayer Image gives us direct pixel data\n\n### Demoisaicing\nHow do we produce the full RGB image from mosaiced sensor output?\n\n- Bilinear Interpolation: average your 4 neighbours\n- Bicubic Interpolation -\u003e needs more neighbours, may overblur\n- Edge-aware interpolatin \n\n### Image Processing Pipeline\nThe sequence of image processing operations applied by the camera's image signal processor (ISP) to convert a RAW image into a regular JPG/PNG.\n\n1. Lens\n2. CFA\n3. Analog Front-end -\u003e RAW image (mosaiced, linear, 12-bit)\n4. White balance\n5. CFA demoisaicing\n6. Denoising\n7. Colour transforms\n8. Tone reproduction\n9. Compression -\u003e final RGB image (non-linear, 8-bit)\n\n## Template Matching\nLinear filtering is also known as template matching. Convolution/correlation can be thought of as comparing a template (the kernel) with each section of the image.\n- Consider the filter and image section as vectors\n- Applying the filter can be interpreted as computing the dot product between the filter and the local image patch\n\nThe correlation is then normalized to between -1 and 1 using cosine similarity, where 1 is the value when the filter and image region are identical. This process is essentially finding the cosine similarity between template and local image neighbourhood\n\n$$\\cos\\theta = \\frac{a \\cdot b}{|a||b|} = \\frac{a \\cdot b}{\\sqrt{(a \\cdot a)(b \\cdot b)}} = \\frac{a}{|a|} \\frac{b}{|b|}$$\n\nThen, we can map over the image and create a correlation map. Thresholding this gives us detections.\n\nGood:\n1. Robust against noise\n2. Relatively easy to compute\nBad:\n1. Scaling (we can address this using scaled representations like a Gaussian image pyramid)\n2. Rotation\n3. Lighting conditions\n4. Sensitive to viewing direction and pose (in 3D worlds)\n\n### Gaussian Image Pyramid\nCollection of representations of an image. Typically, each layer of the pyramid is half the width and half the height of the previous layer. In the Gaussian version, each layer is smoothed by a Gaussian then resampled to get the next layer.\n\nDetails get smoothed out (are completely lost) as we move to higher levels, only large uniform regions of colours in the original image are left.\n\n![Upsampling Process](https://miro.medium.com/max/1016/1*Q9UKqUC6OqpR3KL1yRrXxA.png)\n\n### Laplacian Pyramid\nTo do this, create a Gaussian pyramid and take the difference between one pyramid level and the next after smoothing but before subsampling. \n\nAt each level, retain the residuals (difference between smoothed image and normal image) instead of the blurred images themselves.\n\nConstructing the pyramid, we repeat until min resolution reached:\n1. Blur\n2. Compute Residual\n3. Subsample\n\nReconstructing, we repeat until original resolution reached:\n1. Upsample\n2. Blur\n3. Sum with residual\n\n## Local Feature Detection\n\u003e Moving from global template matching to local template matching (e.g.edges and corners)\n\nAs differentiation is linear and shift invariant, we can implement it as a convolution.\n\nThe discrete approximation is $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} \\approx \\frac{F(X+ \\Delta x, y) - F(x,y)}{\\Delta x}$ where $\\Delta x$ is usually $1$. This is equivalent to a convolution $F$ is a $1 \\times 2$ filter with the first element is $-1$ and the second element is $1$. Note that the derivatives go up for the Y direction and the right for the X direction.\n\nWe usually smooth the image prior to derivative estimation. Increased smoothing\n- eliminates noise edges\n- makes edges smoother and thicker\n- removes fine detail\n\nWeights of a filter for differentiation should sum to 0 as a constant image should have derivative 0.\n\n### Edge Detection\nThe goal here is to identify sudden changes in image brightness as this encodes the vast majority of shape information.\n\nAn edge is a location with high gradient.\n\nMainly caused by\n- Depth discontinuity\n- Surface orientation discontinuity\n- Reflectance discontinuity (e.g. change in material)\n- Illumination discontinuity (e.g. shadows)\n\nAs we usually smooth prior to derivative calculation and convolution is associative, we can combine both steps and use derivatives of Gaussian filters.\n\n$$D \\otimes (G \\otimes I(X,Y)) = (D \\otimes G) \\otimes I(X,Y)$$\n\n#### Sobel (Gradient Magnitude)\nLet $I(X,Y)$ be an image. Then, we let $I_x(X,Y)$ and $I_y(X,Y)$ be estimates of the partial derivatives in the $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively. Then, the vector $[I_x, I_y]$ or $\\nabla f = [\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}]$ is the gradient and $\\sqrt{I_x^2+I_y^2}$ is the gradient magnitude.\n\nThe gradient points in the direction of most rapid increase of intensity. The direction is then $\\theta = \\arctan{\\frac{\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}}{\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}}}$. The strength of the edge is then the magnitude $||\\nabla f|| = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}^2 + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}^2}$.\n\n#### Marr/Hildreth (Laplacian of Gaussian)\n**Design Criteria**\n1. localization of space (find where the edge is)\n2. localization in frequency (identify high frequency and low frequency edges)\n3. rotationally invariant (rotation shouldn't affect edges)\n\nFind the zero-crossings (intercepts) of the Laplacian of the Gaussian. This is $\\nabla^2 G(x,y) = \\frac{-1}{2\\pi\\sigma^4}[2-\\frac{x^2+y^2}{\\sigma^2}]\\exp{(-\\frac{x^2+y^2}{2\\sigma^2})} = 0$\n\nAlternatively, we can say that subtracting the delta function from the Gaussian gives you an approximation of the Laplacian\n\n#### Canny (Local Extrema of 1st deriv)\n**Design Criteria**\n1. good detection (reduce missed edges, reduced edges where edges don't exist)\n2. good localization (accurate edge detection)\n3. one (single) response to a given edge\n\nFind the local extrema of a first derivative operator.\n\nSteps\n1. Apply directional derivatives of Gaussian\n2. Computer gradient magnitude and gradient direction\n3. Perform non-max suppression\n\tNon-max suppression allows us to suppress near-by similar detections to obtain one \"true\" result. In images, we select the maximum point across the width of the edge (following the direction of the gradient).\n \n\tIn implementations, the value at a pixel $q$ must be larger than its interpolated values at $p$ (the next pixel in the direction of the gradient) and $r$ (the previous pixel in the direction of the gradient). Interpolate as needed.\n4. Linking and thresholding\n\tTrying to fix broken edge chains by linking separate edge pixels through taking the normal of the gradient and linking it if the nearest interpolated pixel is also an edge pixel. Accept all edges over low threshold that are connect to an edge over high threshold.\n\t\n|Author|Approach|Detection|Localization|Single Resp|Limitations|\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n|Sobel|Gradient Magnitude Threshold|Good|Poor|Poor|Thick edges|\n|Marr/Hildreth|Zero-crossings of 2nd Derivative|Good|Good|Good|Smooths Corners\n|Canny|Local extrema of 1st Derivative|Best|Good|Good||\n\n### Boundary Detection\nHow closely do image edges correspond to boundaries that humans perceive to be salient or significant? \n\nOne approach is using circular windows of radii $r$ at each pixel $(x,y)$ cut in half by a line that bisects the circle in half. Then, compare visual features on both sides of the cut and if the features are statistically different, then the cut line probably corresponds to a boundary.\n\nFor statistical significance:\n1. Compute non-parametric distribution (histogram) for left side\n2. Compute non-parametric distribution (histogram) for right side\n3. Compare two histograms, on left and right side, using statistical test\n\nExample features include\n- Raw Intensity\n- Orientation Energy\n- Brightness Gradient\n- Color Gradient\n- Texture gradient\n\nFor this implementation, we consider 8 discrete orientations ($\\theta$) and 3 scales ($r$)\n\n### Features\nCorners are locally distinct 2D image features that (hopefully) correspond to a distinct position on a 3D object of interest in the scene.\n\nCannot be an edge as estimation of a location along an edge is close to impossible (the aperture problem)\n\n### Autocorrelation\nCorrelation of the image (distribution of pixel values) with itself. At each pixel, compute its partial derivative w.r.t. either the $x$ or the $y$ axis, $I_y = \\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial y}, I_x = \\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial x}$.\n\nWindows on an edge will have autocorrelation that falls of slowly in the direction of the edge but rapidly orthogonal to the edgge. Windows on a corder will have autocorrelation that falls off rapidly in all directions.\n\n#### Harris Corner Detection\nAs a stats reminder, covariance is the *direction* of the correlation. The closer the covariance is to 1, the closer it is to a perfect positive correlation. -1 implies perfect negative correlation.\n\nWhen drawing distrubtion, draw normals to edges going from low values (dark) to high values (white).\n\n1. Compute image gradients over small region\n2. Compute covariance matrix ![Covariance Matrix](/thoughts/images/covmat.png) (essentially fitting a quadratic to the gradients over the small image patch $P$)\n4. Computer eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix.\n5. Use threshold on eigenvalues to detect corners ($\u003e0$ is a corner)\n\nWe can visualize the covariance matrix $C$ as an ellipse whose axis lengths are determined by the eigenvalues and orientation determined by $R$ (the rotation matrix).\n\nAs $C$ is symmetric, we have \n\n![Covariance matrix as ellipse equation](/thoughts/images/covellipse.png)\n\nWhere the minor axis is $\\lambda_{max}^{-1/2}$ and the major axis is $\\lambda_{min}^{-1/2}$\n\nThen, this is what the eigenvalues tell us:\n- Case 1 (both $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$ are close to zero): flat region\n- Case 2 ($\\lambda_2$ is much greater than $\\lambda_1$): horizontal edge\n- Case 3 ($\\lambda_1$ is much greater than $\\lambda_2$): vertical edge\n- Case 4 ($\\lambda_1$ are both rather large $\\lambda_2$): corner\n\nTo threshold, we can pick a function\n1. Harris \u0026 Stephens: $\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 - \\kappa (\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2)^2$ which is equivalent to $\\det(C) - \\kappa \\textrm{trace}^2(C)$. $\\kappa$ is usually 0.4 or 0.6.\n2. Kanade \u0026 Tomasi: $\\min(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2)$\n3. Nobel: $\\frac{\\det(C)}{\\textrm{trace}(C)+\\epsilon}$\n\n#### Linear Algebra Aside/Review\nGiven a square matrix $A$, a scalar $\\lambda$ is called an **eigenvalue** of $A$ if there exists a nonzero vector $v$ that satisfies\n\n$$Av = \\lambda v$$\n\nThe vector $v$ is called an eigenvector for $A$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda$. The eigenvalues of $A$ are obtained by solving $\\det(A-\\lambda I) = 0$\n\n","title":"Computer Vision"},"/thoughts/consciousness":{"content":"---\ntitle: \"Consciousness\"\ndate: 2021-08-12T23:54:29-04:00\n---\n\nWhat does it mean to be conscious?

Yet,  the two go hand in hand - innovation without the ability to scale and maintain is frivolous, and maintenance without innovation is stagnation.\n\nThere is importance in indigenous knowledge and tradition.\n\nWeb3: shouldering the cost of maintenance among the users rather than centralizing it with the creators\n\nDo Eastern vs Western cultures have diff takes on this? \"Over the course of the 20th century, open societies that celebrated diversity, novelty, and progress performed better than closed societies that defended uniformity and order.\"\n\n## MVP vs Product\nhttps://danluu.com/sounds-easy/\nNot just building out an initial system, but also about how maintainable and scalable the system is for the forseable future.\n\nBusinesses that actually care about turning a profit will spend a lot of time (hence, a lot of engineers) working on optimizing systems, even if an MVP for the system could have been built in a weekend.\n\nThis reminds me of a common fallacy we see in unreliable systems, where people build the happy path with the idea that the happy path is the “real” work, and that error handling can be tacked on later. For reliable systems, error handling is more work than the happy path. The same thing is true for large services -- all of this stuff that people don't think of as “real” work is more work than the core service\n\n## Defining Innovation\nInnovation: the word to hide the lack of substance. A term gains popularity because it resonates with the zeitgeist, reaches buzzword status, then suffers from overexposure and cooptation.\n\nIn formal economic terms, ‘innovation’ involves the diffusion of new things and practices. The term is completely agnostic about whether these things and practices are good. How much of this is tied back to the definition of [progress](thoughts/progress.md)?\n\n* Proved to be useful -\u003e innovations\n* Proved to be useful over 40 years -\u003e technology\n\n### Innovation as a form of maintenance?\nIs there even a distinction of maintenance and innovation? Is maintenance just micro-innovation?\n\nMaintenance is fixing parts of an existing system whereas innovation is wholistic and changing the whole system\n\n## Innovation is overvalued\nhttps://aeon.co/essays/innovation-is-overvalued-maintenance-often-matters-more?utm_source=pocket_mylist\n\n[The Maintainers Organization](https://themaintainers.org/) and their [fellowship](https://themaintainers.org/summer-fellow)\n\n\"What happens _after_ innovation, they argue, is more important. Maintenance and repair, the building of infrastructures, the mundane labour that goes into sustaining functioning and efficient infrastructures, simply has more impact on people’s daily lives than the vast majority of technological innovations.\"\n\n\"These shuttles brought high-tech employees from hip, pricey urban homes to their lush suburban campuses, without exposing them to the inconvenience of public transportation or to the vast populations of the poor and homeless who also call Silicon Valley their home.\" -\u003e similar to some concepts in [fctc](thoughts/books/fctc.md) talking about displacement of people during the 'back to the land'  movement by the New Communalists\n\n**It is crucial to understand that technology is not innovation.** This preoccupation with novelty is unfortunate because it fails to account for technologies in widespread use, and it obscures how many of the things around us are quite old.\n\n[Lindy Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect) -\u003e future life expectancy of a bit of technology is proportional to its current age (i.e. the longer something has survived, the more likely it is to have a longer remaining life expectancy). Longevity implies a resistance to change, obsolescence or competition and greater odds of continued existence into the future.\n\nThe stalest innovation stories focus on well-to-do white guys sitting in garages in a small region of California, but human beings in the Global South live with technologies too. Which ones? Where do they come from? How are they produced, used, repaired?\n\nThird, focusing on [infrastructure](thoughts/infrastructure.md) or on old, existing things rather than novel ones reminds us of the absolute centrality of the work that goes into keeping the entire world going. We need to acknowledge and attribute where we are today to the shoulders of the giants we stand on.\n\n'Broken world thinking' -\u003e focus on constant process of entropy and undoing of work and what we can do to slow/halt this process rather than introducing new things. Curious how this relates to [climate tech](thoughts/climate-tech.md) and general escapist vibes of people like Elon wanting to escape to space rather than fixing problems with our current world.\n\n\"Feminist theorists have long argued that obsessions with technological novelty obscures all of the labour, including housework, that women, disproportionately, do to keep life on track.\"\n\n## On shifting the focus too quickly\n\"One important topic of conversation is the danger of moving too triumphantly from innovation to maintenance. There is no point in keeping the practice of hero-worship that merely changes the cast of heroes without confronting some of the deeper problems underlying the innovation obsession.\"\n\n## Incentivizing Maintenance\n*The Maintainers*: the individuals whose work keeps ordinary existence going rather than introducing novel things. Related to [paid open source](posts/paid-open-source.md), how do we incentivize maintenance?\n\nIs maintenance just the battle against the [tragedy of the commons](thoughts/tragedy-of-the-commons.md)? \"Fundamentally, digital infrastructure has a free rider problem.

Architectural Decentralization: how many physical computers is a system made of? how many computers can fail before the network fails?\n2. Political Decentralization: how many individuals/organizations ultimately control the computers that the system is made up of?\n3. Logical Decentralization: are the data structures used to represent the system more monolithic or swarm-like? if you cut the system in half (both providers and users), will both halves continue to fully operate as independent units?\n\nNotes:\n* Architectural centralization often leads to political centralization (at least in the physical world, less true for digital spaces)\n\n## Centralization\n[Source](https://onezero.medium.com/why-decentralization-matters-5e3f79f7638e)\n\nFollow a predictable life cycle along the S-shaped adoption curve.\n\nAt the beginning, will do everything they can to garner usage and appear more valuable as platforms with multi-sided positive network effects. However, when they move up the S-curve, their power grows. Eventually, the relationships turn from positive-sum to zero-sum. Thus, to continue growing, they must extract from users (e.g. selling user data, taxing profits, etc.)\n\n\u003e Centralized systems often start out fully baked, but only get better at the rate at which employees at the sponsoring company improve them. Decentralized systems start out half-baked but, under the right conditions, grow exponentially as they attract new contributors.\n\n## Why Decentralize?\n1. [**Fault Tolerance**](thoughts/fault-tolerance.md), less likely to fail accidentally because they rely on many separate redundant components\n2. **Attack resistance**, no central point to attack\n3. **Collusion resistance**\n\n### Counterpoints\n#### Fault Tolerance\nCommon mode failure, all pieces can fail for the same reason. (e.g. all nodes in a blockchain run the same software but that software has a bug)\n\nTo counteract this,\n- have multiple competing implementations\n- knowledge of technical considerations behind underlying protocol must be public and democratized\n- core stakeholders should be from multiple companies/orgs or just multiple volunteers\n- use [proof of stake](thoughts/proof-of-stake.md) to move away from hardware centralization risk\n\n#### Attack Resistance\nFrom a purely mathematical and game theory perspective, decentralization may not even matter. In a finality reversion (e.g. 51% attack), a huge loss of say $50M is still $50M regardless of whether you have validators in 1 org or 10.\n\nHowever, after considering coercion, decentralization becomes much more important. It's much harder to threaten 100 people than 1.\n\n#### Collusion Resistance\n\u003e Collusion is \"coorindation that we don't like\"\n\n[consensus](thoughts/consensus.md) model relies on **uncoordinated choice model**, the asusmption that the game consists of many small actors that make decisions independently\n\nYet, 90% of the entire Bitcion network's mining power can show up at the same conference (as 7 men).

Usability goals are primarily objective, user experience goals are more subjective.\n\n### Usability Goals\nUsability refers to esnuring that interactive products are easy to learn, effective to use, and enjoyable from the user's perspective. Following 6 goals:\n\n1. Effective to use (effectiveness). Is the product capable of allowing people to learn, carry out their work efficiently, access the information that they need, or buy the goods that they want?\n2. Efficient to use (efficiency). Once users have learned how to use a product to carry out their tasks, can they sustain a high level of productivity?\n3. Safe to use (safety). What is the range of errors that are possible using the product, and what measures are there to permit users to recover easily from them?\n4. Having good utility (utility). Does the product provide an appropriate set of functions that will enable users to carry out all of their tasks in the way they want to do them?\n5. Easy to learn (learnability). Is it possible for the user to work out how to use the product by exploring the interface and trying certain actions? How hard will it be to learn the whole set of functions in this way? Should have good transfer effects (where knowledge acquired earlier improves one's ability to learn/perform in another context)\n6. Easy to remember how to use (memorability). What types of interface support have been provided to help users remember how to carry out tasks, especially for products and operations they use infrequently?\n\nExamples of commonly used usability criteria\n-   time to complete a task (efficiency)\n-   time to learn a task (learnability)\n-   number of errors made when carrying out a task over time (memorability)\n\n### User Experience Goals\nThese are concerned with how users experience an interactive product from their perspective, rather than assessing how useful or productive a system is from its own perspective\n\nDesirable aspects of UX\n- Satisfying\n- Enjoyable\n- Helpful\n- Fun\n- Provocative\n\nUndesirable aspects of UX\n- Making one feel stupid or guilty\n- Cutesy\n- Gimmicky\n- Frustrating\n\nThese are combined in a user's multi-faceted experience of a product\n\n### Design Principles\n\u003e Generalizable abstractions intended to orient designers toward thinking about different aspects of their designs\n\nConcerned with what users should see and do when carrying out their tasks using an interactive product: the dos and don'ts of interaction design.\n\n1. High visibility: ensure functions are easy to find and intuitive.\n2. Feedback: time sensitive information about what actions has been done and what has been accomplished.\n3. Constraints: ways of restricting the user interaction to those which are valid in any given moment.\n4. Consistency: an interface which follows rules, such as using the same operation to select all objects.\n5. Affordance: attributes should obviously signal what they can use it for. Afford means \"to give a clue\"\n\nThe problem when applying these to real world is that trade-offs can arise between principles (e.g. increased constraint might mean less visibility).","title":"Design Goals"},"/thoughts/design-process":{"content":"---\ntitle: \"Design Process\"\ndate: 2021-10-13\n---\n\nThis is *different* from the [double diamond-design](thoughts/double-diamond-design.md) model.\n\n1.

(what non-users are involved in the problem/solution?)\n    -   what is the task? (what are they _really_ trying to do, and what is getting in the way?)\n    -   Evaluation: ethnography, observation, interviews, focus groups, questionnaires, surveys\n2.  Early design: **explore** design space\n    -   consider approaches\n    -   consider important metrics for different approaches and high-risk elements\n    -   Evaluation: interviews, focus groups, observation, questionnaries, surveys, contextual inquiry + work modeling, task analysis, task / cognitive walktrhoughs, participatory design, heuristic evaluation\n3.  Mid design: **develop** chosen approach\n    -   confirm chosen approach\n    -   reduce risk\n    -   consider user input needed to verify design progress and prototypes necessary for problem-solving\n    -   Evaluation: observation, interviews, questionnaires, surveys, heuristic evaluation, formal performance/usability testing\n4.

They are public spaces where a lot of people coincidentally share the same space for a short period in time. It has the same energy as commuting -- a familiar yet ever-changing context.\n\nThe park and the trees may stay the same most times you visit yet the people on the benches and walking on the paved paths are always different. One can sit and observe all the people moving by, [wondering what their life is like.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People-watching).\n\n\u003e \"What would it look like to do that with your favorite internet neighborhoods?\"\n\nThis is a small reflection on potential new avenues to explore for digital spaces. Not to say that any existing ones are bad but I am interested to see what new direction we can take to explore how we use technology to further human connection.\n\n### Serendipity in Public Spaces\nSerendipity is bumping into new people you otherwise wouldn't have talked to or sought out. It's the casual bus or subway chatter, the queue neighbour, or stranger reading on a park bench. It's the opposite of intentionality.\n\nAre there ways to be _less_ intentional with digital interactions?\n\nIf you want to meet with someone you need to schedule it or visit a link, etc. There is no 'random' interaction. Even algorithmic experiences are like being carried away by the TikTok or Facebook algorithm rather than something out of the blue. Though these experiences may seem random at times, they are explicitly currated with an _end goal_ in mind.\n\nAre there any spaces that don't have ulterior motives and are just places of gathering? The only example that comes to mind where 'coincidental' interaction happen is within currated [interest groups](thoughts/social-graphs.md) like onlike network forums around games or technologies or early communities lead by superconnectors like the [Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link (WELL)](thoughts/books/fctc). How can we recreate these public 'watering holes' for people to gather around? \n\n### Permanence in Private Spaces\nPermance means that the environment reflects that people have been there. A shared garden to tend to, a bookshelf to work through, a guestbook of all the people who have dropped in and out.\n\nSo many of our mediums have now tended towards [real time](thoughts/ephemereal-content.md) in an effort to replicate the fleeting nature of face-to-face conversation; vanishing messages, video chats, and audio rooms. Yet, rarely do any of these platforms leave any indication whether a conversation ever happened between two people.\n\nIs there any way we can create shared *artifacts* that are permanent and can be grown over time? A digital indication that a space is lived in and occupied?\n\nAs of now, most platforms keep a primative chat log or history but thats it. What if there was a way to create digital [gardens](https://twitter.com/samihusseni/status/1329499588982575104) to foster and maintain existing relationships? A commonspace you could both take care of, share, and contribute to. Completely private common spaces often allow users to put whatever and allow people can construct their own digital nooks and cozy spaces.\n\nMaybe this involves having a shared calendar, todo list, books. Or even just a space to co-live and co-exist in [virtual worlds](thoughts/virtual-worlds.md). Most online RPG games (think Animal Crossing, Minecraft, Stardew valley) give the option for users to have a shared space to exist and build together (and where both people don't necessarily both need to be present for the space to function). Why doesn't this exist outside of the gaming sphere?\n\nCan we create permanence of artifacts without sacrificing ephemerality in medium?\n\n## Tools for Digital Spaces\nGiven that there are so many different types of digital spaces, I wanted to explore how different tools are supporting and facilitating different sorts of digital human interaction.

The result was the centralization and consolidation of the Internet — the true y2k tragedy. This tragedy unfolded in stages, a gradual infringement of rights: users had to first be made transparent to their internet service providers, and then they were made transparent to the internet services they used, and finally they were made transparent to one another. The intimate linking of users' online personas with their offline legal identity was an iniquitous squandering of liberty and technology that has resulted in today's atmosphere of accountability for the citizen and impunity for the state. Gone were the days of self-reinvention, imagination, and flexibility, and a new era emerged — a new eternal era — where our pasts were held against us. Forever.\n\nEverything we do now lasts forever... The Internet's synonymizing of digital presence and physical existence ensures fidelity to memory, identitarian consistency, and ideological conformity. Be honest: if one of your opinions provokes the hordes on social media, you're less likely to ditch your account and start a new one than you are to apologize and grovel, or dig in and harden yourself ideologically. Neither of those \"solutions\" is one that fosters change, or intellectual and emotional growth\n\nThe forced identicality of online and offline lives, and the permanency of the Internet's record, augur against forgiveness, and advise against all mercy. Technological omniscence, and the ease of accessibility, promulgate a climate of censorship that in the so-called free world instantiates as self-censorship: people are afraid to speak and so they speak the party's words... or people are afraid to speak and so they speak no words at all...\n\nEven the most ardent practitioners of cancel culture — which I've always read as an imperative: Cancel culture! — must admit that cancellation is a form of surveillance borne of the same technological capacities used to oppress the vulnerable by patriachal, racist, and downright unkind governments the world over.

Discovering requirements (discover/define phase). Deciding what to design is key, and exploring the problem space is one way to decide. The goal is understanding the target users and the support an interactive product could provide.\n2. Designing alternatives (develop phase). This can be 2 parts, conceptual design (producing the ocnceptual model of the product) or concrete design (detail of the product like colours, sounds, images, etc.)\n3. Prototyping alternative designs to be communicated and assessed (develop phase). The process of designing behaviour of interactive products as well as look and feel. Doesn't necessarily need working software!\n4. Evaluating the product and the UX it ofers (develop phase). Determine the usability and acceptability of the product or design measured in terms of a varierty of usability and user-experience criteria.\n\nHere are a few good questions to ask to better understand the problem:\n-   what are the human needs?\n-   who are the stakeholders?\n-   what are the central tasks?\n-   what might we want to learn?

AI\"\ndate: 2021-07-02T15:01:46-04:00\n---\n\n# Dreyfus\n## Why Heideggerian AI failed and how fixing it would require making it more Heideggerian\n-   the [frame](/thoughts/frame-problem) approach → descriptions of typical situations like going to a birthday party\n\t-   however, this quickly grows out of hand once again as any AI program using frames to organize millions of meaningless facts so as to retrieve the relevant frames is going to be caught in a cycle of finding frames for recognizing relevant frames for recognizing relvant facts\n-   an emergent heideggerian cognitive science → embodied-embedded thinking is under active investigation and development\n-   john haugeland → cognition is embedded and embodied\n## Three approaches to supposedly Heideggerian AI\n-   Rodney Brook's behaviourist approach\n\t-   it turns out to be very difficult to reproduce in an internal representation for a computer the necessary richness of environment that would give rise to interesting behaviour by a highly adaptive robot\n\t\t-   this is avoided by human beings because their model of the world is the world itself\n\t\t-   \"the best model of the world is the world itself\"\n\t-   build a mobile robot that uses the world itself as its own representation (referring to its sensors rather than to an internal world model)\n\t-   problems\n\t\t-   does not learn\n\t\t-   operates in a fixed world, responding only to a small set of possibly relevant features that their receptors can pick up\n-   Phil Agre's pragmatist model\n\t-   use of deictic representations\n\t\t-   instead of representing a particular object in the world\n\t\t-   represent a role that an object might play in a certain time-extended pattern of interaction between an agent and its environment\n\t-   objectified both functions and situational relevance for the agent\n\t\t-   e.g. when a virtual ice cube defined by its functions is close to the virtual player, a rule dictates a response, e.g. kick it\n\t\t-   no learning takes place\n\t\t\t-   as such, finesses rather than solves the frame problem\n\t\t-   heidegger's view is that this function should not be fixed\n\t-   merleau-ponty's work → nonrepresentational account of the way the body and the world are coupled\n\t\t-   as an agent learned, skills are not stored as internal representations\n\t\t-   rather experiences are presented to the learned as more finely discriminated situations\n\t\t\t-   e.g. as you learn to cook, experiences are presented that are more finely discriminated like having a better cooked egg vs a poorly done one\n\t\t-   if the situation does not clearly solicit a single response or if the response does not produce a satisfactory result, the learner is led to further refine the descrimination\n## Walter Freeman's neurodynamic model\n-   basic Cartesian model\n\t1.  the brain receives input from the universe by way of its sense organs\n\t2.  out of this stimulus information, the brain abstracts features, which it uses to construct a representation of the world\n-   how are these accomplished in AI systems\n\t-   applying rules such as frames/scripts of GOFAI → acknowledged as not solving the [frame problem](/thoughts/frame-problem)\n\t-   strengthening/weakening weights on connections between neurons in an ANN (connectionist)\n\t\t-   significance is added from outside since the net is not seeking anything -\u003e [representation](/thoughts/representation)\n-   both approaches treat the computer/brain as a passive receiver of bits of meaningless data, which then have significance added to them\n\t-   big problem is, how the brain binds the relevant features together\n\t-   neural version of the frame problem → how can the brain keep track of which facts in its representation of the current world are relevant to which other facts\n-   his approach implies the involvement of the whole brain in perception and action\n\t-   rather than detecting features and processing the features step-by-step towards a unified represetnation\n\t-   given that the environment is already significant for the animal, how can the animal select a unified significant figure from the noisy background?\n\t-   transforms binding problem → selection problem\n\t-   animal's perceptual system is primed by past experience and arousal to seek and be rewarded by relevant experiences\n\t\t-   hebbian rule → synapses between neurons that fire together become stronger as long as the synchronous firing is accompanied by a reward\n\t\t-   form 'cell assemblies'\n\t\t-   \"if a male animal has just eaten and is ready to mate, the gain is turned down on the cell assemblies responsive to food smells and tuned up on female smells\"\n-   concept of energy states\n\t-   state tends toward minimum \"energy\"\n\t-   minimum energy states are called attractors\n\t-   brain states that tend towards a particular attractor are called that attractor's \"basin of attraction\"\n\t-   when learning, the brain forms a new basin of attraction for each new significant class of inputs → significance of past experience is preserved in an attractor landscape\n-   each new attractor does not represent a thing, rather, the brain's current state is the result of the sum of the animal's past experience with the thing\n\t-   constantly updated landscape of attractors is correlated with the agent's experience of the changing significance of things in the world (intentional arc)\n-   no fixed representations, when an animal learns to respond to a new odor, there is a shift in all other patterns (even those not directly involved with the learning)\n\t-   different from GOFAI, memory stores in computers in which each item is positioned by a discrete address or branch of serach tree\n-   simulated through computers as states of the model are representations of brain states (possible to represent as global state transitions from one attractor basin to another is discrete), not features of things in the everyday world\n-   actually modeled the activity of the brain of the salamander sufficiently to simulate the salamander's foraging and self-preservation capacities\n## How heideggerian ai would dissolve rather than avoid or solve the frame problem\n-   why do we cope\n\t-   heidegger → we are constantly solicited to improve our familiarity with the world\n\t-   in our skilled activity, we are drawn to move so as to achieve a better and better grip on our situation\n\t\t-   don't need any mental representation of one's goal nor any problem solving\n\t\t-   steady flow of skillful activity in response to the situation\n\t\t-   when situation deviates from some optimal position, one's activity takes one closer to the optimum and thereby relives the \"tension\" of the deviation\n\t\t-   one does not need to know that the optimum is in order to move towards it\n\t\t-   ones body is simply drawn to lower the tension\n-   binding problem → how brains segregate elements in complex patterns of sensory input so that they are allocated to discrete \"objects\"\n-   wheeler thinks that the simplest test of the viability of any proposed AI program is whether it can solve the frame problem\n-   heideggerian ai needs a particular way of being embedded and embodied such that what we experience is significant for us in the particular way that it is\n-   need to

This means discovering what it does, how it works, and what operations are possible.\n\nThis is composed up of 5 fundamental psychological concepts which are the principles of interaction:\n1. **Affordances**:  signifies *what* action is possible. It is the relationship between the properties of an objects and the capabilities of the user that determine how the object could be used. For example, a chair affords (\"is for\") support and therefore affords sitting. If an affordance or anti-affordance cannot be perceived, some means of signaling its presence is required.\n2. **Signifiers**: signifies *where* actions should occur. A mark, sound, or perceivable indicator that communicates appropriate behaviour to a person. Can be a desire path, a push/pull label, etc. However, we sohuld be aware that different cultures associate different meanings with different signifiers.\n3. **Constraints**: limits to the possible interactions with an object. For example, the different sized holes in a scissor suggests different numbers of fingers may fit in each hole and not any more.\n4. **Mappings**: relationship between the elements of two sets of things. For example, a mapping of light switches to light bulbs or the steering wheel to the direction of the wheels. Groupings and proximity are important principles from Gestalt psychology that can be used to map controls to function: related controls should be grouped together. \n5. **Feedback**: communicating the results of an action or some way of letting you know that the system is working on your request. Has to be a balance, little and poor feedback and too much feedback can also be unhelpful and annoying to users. Feedback is essential, but not when it gets in the way of other things, including a calm and relaxing environment.\n\nConceptual models are explanations (usually highly simplified) of how something works. These can be the desktop metaphor where files, folders, and icons help represent the model of data on the hard drive. We are concerned with mentally held conceptual models -- mental models.\n\nOften times the designer's conceptual model, the system image (how it manifests in reality), and the user's conceptual model are not aligned.","title":"Human Centered Design (HCD)"},"/thoughts/information":{"content":"---\ntitle: \"Information\"\ndate: 2021-09-21T09:30:22-07:00\n---\n\n\u003e Information is a thing that conveys meaning about stuff, transmitted from one place to another.\n\n[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfP7AjwIZI8)\n\nCharacteristics\n* Truthfulness: information is correct\n* Aboutness: tells us about something else\n* Thingness: information is a thing, although perhaps intangible\n\nThe study of information in and of itself is a research area too, through [education and epistemology](toc/education-and-epistemology.md) and the [Information Professions](thoughts/information-professions.md)\n\n### Hierarchy\nIn informatics, there exists the concept of an Information Hierarchy, Knowledge Pyramid, or DIKW Hierarchy.\n\nData is transformed into Information, which is transformed into Knowledge, which is then transformed into Wisdom.\n\n1.

What techniques can be used, and how useful and reliable is the data that is collected?\n\nFive Key Issues\n1. Settings Goals. Goals will influence the nature of data gathering sessions, the data gathering techniques to be used, and the analysis to be performed.\n2. Identifying Participants. Those who fit the profile of types of people from whom data can be gathered are called the study population. Types of sampling are as follows:\n  - Probability Sampling: simple random sampling or stratified sampling\n  - Nonprobability Sampling: convenience sampling or volunteer panels\n    - Convenience Sampling: sample includes those who were available rather than those specifically selected\n3. Relationship with Participants: informed consent with a clear and professional relationship between participant and researcher (however, informed consent is generally not required when gathering requirements data for commercial company where a contract usually exist between collector and provider)\n\nTriangulation: the investigation of a phenomenon from at least two different perspectives. This is mostly focused on verification and reliability of data rather than making up for the limitations of another type of methodology\n1. Triangulation of data: data is drawn from different sources at different times/places/people\n2. Investigator triangulation: different researchers (observers, interviewers, and so on) have been involved in collecting and interpreting the data\n3. Triangulation of theories: use of different theoretical frameworks through which to view data\n4. Methodological triangulation: employ different data gathering techniques\n\n## 3 Methods for Data Recording\n1. Notes + Photographs -\u003e least technical and most flexible way of recording data, but can be difficult to capture the right highlights.\n2. Audio + Photographs -\u003e less intrusive than video, allows observers to focus on the activity rather than on trying to capture every spoken word.\n3. Video -\u003e highest fidelity. Things to keep in mind: 1) whether to fix cam position or use a roving recorder 2) where to point the camera 3) understanding the imapct of the recording on the participants\n\n## Interviews\n\u003e A conversation with a purpose\n\nGood for exploring issues, learning more about tasks, and getting inside user's head.\n\nCriteria for good interview:\n    -   Before:\n        -   get questions right → should support goals, should be easy to understand/answer\n        -   be organized → check equipment, have necessary docs\n        -   run pilots\n    -   During:\n        -   structure time\n        -   give participants context\n        -   use props and visuals → easier to show than tell\n    -   Listen well throughout!\n\n1. Open-ended/unstructured -\u003e exploratory and similar to conversation. Can be time-consuming but can also produce rich insights\n2. Semi-structured -\u003e plans basic script with both closed and open questions but probes interviewee until no new relevants info is there\n3. Structured -\u003e predetermined questions like a questionnaire, study is standardized (same questions with each participant)\n4. Group interviews -\u003e 3-10 people selected to provide a representative sample of the target population. Useful for investigating shared issues rather than individual experiences\n\nAsking questions like \"Can you tell me a bit more about...\" is called probing\n\n### Planning\nWhen developing Interview Questions, keep in mind open questions are best suited where the goal of the session is exploratory; closed questions are best suited where the possible answers are known in advance. Break long or compound questions into separate questions\n\nA lot of decisions to make:\n- Choosing a framework\n- Level of participation to adopt\n- How to make a record of the data\n- How to gain acceptance into the group being studied\n- How to ensure that the study uses difference perspectives\n\nEthnography: the description of the customs of people and cultures. A distinguishing feature of ethnographic studies compared with other data gathering is that a situation is observed without imposing any a priori structure or framework upon it, and everything is viewed as \"strange\".\n\n| Technique | Good for | Kind of Data | Advantages | Disadvantages |\n| --------- | -------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------------- |\n| Interviews | Exploring issues | Mostly qualitative (some quantitative) | Interviewer can guide, encourages contact between researchers and users | Artificial environment might be intimidating, remove them from usual environment |\n| Focus Groups | Collecting multiple viewpoints | Mostly qualitative (some quantitative) | Highlight areas of agreement/conflict, encourages contact between researchers and users | Possibility of dominant characters |\n| Questionnaires | Answering specific questions | Quantitative and Qualitative | Can reach many people with low resource requirements | Design is key, response rates may be low |\n| Direct observation in the field | Understanding context of user activity | Mostly qualitative | Observational insights | Very time-consuming, huge amounts of data |\n| Direct observation in a controlled environment | Captural detail of individuals | Quantitative and qualitative | User can focus on task without interruption | Data may be of limited use due to artificial environment |\n| Indirect observation | Observing users in natural environment without distraction | Quantitative (logging) and qualitative (diary) | Can be long due to automative recording | Large amounts of data implies need for tools to support analysis, participants may exaggerate memories |\n\n### Running the interview\nBefore starting, make sure that the goals of the interview have been explained to the interviewee and that they are willing to proceed. Listen more than talk, repond with sympathy but without bias, and to appear to enjoy the interview.\n\n1.  **Intro**\n    -   interviewer introduces themselves\n    -   explain why you're doing the interview\n    -   reassure interviewee re: ethical issues\n    -   ask interviewee if they mind being recorded\n2.  **Warm-up session**\n    -   easy, nonthreatening questions\n3.  **Main session**\n    -   questions presented in logical sequence\n    -   probing questions at the end\n    -   order may vary in semi-structured interview\n4.  **Cooling-off period**\n    -   easy questions to defuse any tension\n5.  **Closing session**\n    -   interviewer thanks interviewee\n    -   switch off recorder or put notebook away\n\n## Observation\nUsers may be observed directly by the investigator as they perform their activities or indirectly through records of the activity that are studied afterward.\n\nObservation can also result in a lot of data to sift through and can be complicated to do well than at firs appreciated. As such, a clearly stated goal is important to have focus for an observation session.\n\nExample frameworks:\n- The person: Who is using the technology at any particular time?\n- The place: Where are they using it?\n- The thing: What are they doing with it?\n\n3 common approaches\n1. Simple observation: user is given a task, the evaluator just watches. This gives no insight into users' decision process\n2. Think aloud: subjects asked to say what they are thinking/doing. However, its hard to talk while concentrating and thinking may alter the way people naturally perform the task.\n3. Co-discovery learning: two people work together on a task and normal conversation is monitored.\n\n### Degree of Participation\n1. Passive Observer: observer who adopts an approach at the outsider end; does not take part in the study environment at all\n2. Participant Observer: adopts an approach at the insider end; becomes a member of the group being studied\n\n### Coding Sheet\n\u003e A data recording instrument in which a list of itemized coding options are structured\n\nThis standardizes observation practices which makes it more objective.\n\nConsider:\n-   evaluation goals (break it all down!)\n-   stage of design\n-   observation method/types of data\n\t-   what would potentially be an interesting finding from this particular style?\n\t-   e.g. for think-aloud, it might be good to record action vs spoken comments\n\n## Questionnaire\nSurvey vs Questionnaire: the questionnaire is a *part* of the survey. The questionnaire is just the concrete thigns you're asking.\n\nPros\n-   cheap\n-   does not require presence of evaluator\n-   many results can be quantified\n\nCons\n-   preparation is \"expensive\" → need to design questions well\n-   can have low response rate or low quality response\n-   difficult to do in-depth \"probing\"\n\nA questionnaire is good when motivation is high enough without anyone else present. If persuasion is needed, a structured interview is probably better\n\n### Designing a Questionnaire\nKeep in mind\n- what info is sought?\n- how would you analyze results?\n- what audience do you want to reach?\n- what will you do with your analysis?\n\nDon't use vague questions, pilot the questionnaire before testing.\n\nQuestions\n- should not be transferable to other interfaces, can't be interpreted in different ways depending on judgement (i.e. domain specific and clear wording)\n-  avoid double-barrelled questions and leading questions\n-  to de-bias: neutral language, can have random order of questions for different participants\n-  for validity\n\t-  use previously validated questionnaires\n\t-  traingulation (ask multiple questions about the same matter)\n\t-  piloting\n\n#### Types of questions**\n- Open-ended (hard to analyze rigorously)\n- Closed (easily analyzed but can be hard to interpret if not well-designed)\n\t-  checkboxes and ranges\n\t\t-   range of answers to demo questions is predictable: offer a predefined list\n\t\t-   interval doesn't have to be equal in all cases, depends on what you want to know\n\t\t-   mention how many boxes to check, be consistent with ascending/descending order\n\t-   likert and semantic differential scale\n\t\t-   used for measuring opinions, attitudes, and beliefs\n\t\t-   widely used for evaluating user satisfaction\n\t\t-   likert: a five, seven, or nine-point agreement scale used to measure respondents' agreement with various statements\n\t\t-   semantic differential scale: rely on choosing pairs of adjectives to explore a range of bipolar attitudes about particular opinions\n\t-   ranked (closed)\n\t\t-   respondent places ordering on items in a list\n\t\t-   useful to indicate preferences\n\t\t-   forced choice\n\t-   multi-choice (closed)\n\t\t-   offered choice of explicit responses\n\nChecklist\n-   think about ordering of questions → impact can be influenced by order\n-   consider if different versions are needed for different populations\n-   provide clear instructions on how to complete questionnaire\n    -   eg. if answers can be saved and completed later\n-   think about length → avoid questions that don't address study goals\n-   consider allowing respondents to opt out at different stages especially if long → better to have some than none\n-   think about layout and pacing\n\n## Data and Analysis\n- Subjective: what you were told what happened\n- Objective: what you captured using your senses\n- Quantative: data in the form of numbers or data that can be easily translated into numbers. Focuses on ascertain magnitude, amount, or size of something\n- Qualitative: data in the form of words and images. Focuses on nature of something (themes, patterns, and stories)\n\nNote that quantitative data is not always objective! Subjectivity can come from participants in how they express opinions or from investigators during the data capturing/interpreting/analysis process.\n\nSimilarly, it is unfair to try to [quantize](thoughts/labels-and-quantization.md) all qualitative data. This needs justification. Also be wary of translating small populatino sizes into percentages.\n\n### What to focus on\n1. What are the most important needs/tasks to support?\n2. What are the repeated patterns?\n3. Key issues/areas that could be improved\n4. What surprised you?\n5. What is essential/nonessential in implementation\n\n### Steps\n1. Initial reactions or observations (identify patterns, simple numerical analysis like averages, ratios, percentages)\n2. Data cleansing (checking for erroneous entries and anomalies)\n3. Analysis\n\n### Qualitative Analysis\n#### Thematic Analysis\nThemes are a small number of high-level patterns that answer your evaluation questions.\n\nGoing from codes (descriptive labels) to categories (grouping imposed on codes) to themes (interpretive patterns). Deductive analysis is just the inverse (starting at themes and arriving at codes)\n\nDo an initial pass to check of internal consistency: make sure themes occur across several or all participants. Then, step back to see if an overarching narrative emerges from the themes. One can them remove themes or look into why there are conflicts.\n\nOne way of doing this is using affinity diagrams:\n1.  record each idea/observation/problem/etc on individual card or post-it notes\n2.  look for notes that seem to be related\n3.  sort notes into groups until all used\n    -   sort and resort as necessary\n\n#### Categorizing Data\n-   scheme of data: code the data according to categories\n\t-   if analysis frame is chosen beforehand: deductive analysis\n\t-   if study is explanatory and it is important to let themes emerge from data: inductive analysis\n-   can then analyze with appropriate methods like counting averages # of problems or identifying recurring patterns\n\n### Critical Incident Analysis\nHelps identify significant subsets of data for more detailed analysis.\n\nThis is not about summarizing all incidients, more like finding gold nuggets. Incidents need not be bad all the time, can be either desirable or undesirable.\n\n","title":"Interviews and Data Recording"},"/thoughts/introductions":{"content":"---\ntitle: \"Introductions\"\ndate: 2021-06-05T19:47:49-04:00\n---\n\nwhy i can never do good introductions\n* apply [labels](/thoughts/labels-and-quantization) to things\n* people have expectations\n    * self-imposed as well\n* first of many experiences → why do we feel the need to get it right at the start?\n\n## Intersectional Identities\n\u003e \"A man may be regarded as the point of intersection of an indefinite number of circles representing social groups\" -- -   Cooley, Human Nature and the Social Order (1922)\n\nCooley imagined affiliations and interests as a system of coordinates, with each additional group determining one's individuality and identity more accurately.\n\n\"These 'reciprocally constructing phenomena' that may empower one person with increasing self-actualization, burden others with exponentially debilitating oppression.\" Related: the matrix of domination and intersectional theory in [Design Justice](thoughts/books/design-justice.md)\n\n## Idolization\nhttps://blog.matthewwang.me/life/concise21/2021/03/01/on-idolization.html\n* \"You implicitly invalidate any struggles they have, and eschew their private life.

Is it necessarily so?\n\nProgress, loosely defined by [Tyler Cowen and Patrick Collison](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/we-need-new-science-progress/594946/), is \"the combination of economic, technological, scientific, cultural, and organizational advancement that has transformed our lives and raised standards of living over the past couple of centuries\"\n\n**Progress implies direction. Progress towards what?** Does this require alignment of values? Is progress enabling us to better express our [identities](thoughts/introductions.md)?\n\nProgress isn't equal, it's multiplicative. It's \"a mixed blessing—one that resulted in technologies that have allowed many people to live longer, safer lives, but that has, simultaneously, destroyed global ecosystems, caused the extinction of many living species, facilitated rampant population growth, and wreaked havoc on climate systems, the effects of which will be an increase in droughts, floods, storms, and erratic weather patterns that threaten most global societies.\" [Source](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/09/the-industrial-revolution-and-its-discontents/379781/)\n\nThere are no 'thought leaders' in bleeding tech, only in established fields. Everyone at the edge of a field is a 'pioneer' in a sense. \n\nAfter a subject gets established, how do we continue to make progress through research?

The main argument against it was that it implies a disrespect of previous generations.\n\nIs progress a result of a more creation focused lens rather than a [maintenance](thoughts/creation-vs-maintenance.md) focused one? Finding answers through working on new things rather than what was revealed in the past\n\nSo many historically 'truthful' sources like the Church and classical science were wrong about fundamental aspects of the universe (e.g. Earth being the centre of the universe). \"By 1600, much of ancient wisdom had crumbled.\"\n\nSkepticism as the taproot of all knowledge, heavily [Cartesian](thoughts/virtual-worlds.md)\n\nHowever, writing, the printing press, and other tools allowed us to [extend our mind](thoughts/extended-mind.md) and conceive of knowledge as **cumulative**.\n\n## Progress Studies\nThe study of the *how* and *why* of progress.\n\nThere are ecosystems that are better at generating progress than others, perhaps by orders of magnitude. What do they have an in common?\n\nWhat enables progress? \"Why did Silicon Valley happen in California rather than Japan or Boston? Why was early-20th-century science in Germany and Central Europe so strong? Can we deliberately engineer the conditions most hospitable to this kind of advancement or effectively tweak the systems that surround us today?\"\n\nHow can we enable useful progress in the future? \n\nFrom a more epistemlogical standpoint, how much of progress just comes down to good:\n1. pedagogy (re: [mindstorms](thoughts/books/mindstorms.md))\n2. networks (re: [social-graphs](thoughts/social-graphs.md))\n3. chance and circumstance\n\n\"Organizations as varied as Y Combinator, MIT’s Radiation Lab, and ARPA have astonishing track records in catalyzing progress far beyond their confines.

What was the relationship between [funding](thoughts/funding.md) and knowledge?\n\t2. Philosophy of technology / technological progress: How, why, and when do particular technologies emerge?\n\t3. Meta-science / science of science / social epistemology of science: How do we educate, train, and incentivize scientists?\n\t4. Mechanism design + incentive design: How do we design incentives to elicit certain behaviours and aggregate specific information?\n\t5. Cultural components of change-making: How have humans organized change in the past around ideas and processes?\n\t6. Cause prioritization: How do we decide what to focus on?\n2. Definition and measurement: What sort of world(s) should we be we building towards?\n\t1. Visions of the future: What type of future/utopia do we want to live in? **Is progress to one person necessarily progress to the collective?** rel: [The ones who walk from Omelas](thoughts/articles/the-ones-who-walk-from-omelas.md)\n\t2. Progress definition and measurement: How do we define progress and metrics?\n3. Drawbacks of progress: What are the risks incurred by progress? How do we make differential progress?\n\t1. Costs of progress: Can progress be too fast? How do we mitigate risks (esp those that are irreversible and existential)?\n\t2. Robust decision-making and better prediction under uncertainty: How can we better predict the impacts of our actions?\n\t\t1. (re: [catch22](thoughts/catch22.md) and the collingridge dilemma)\n\n## What type of Progress?\n\nDo we care more about technological progress or social progress? We can measure social progress via, maybe, [Gini coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient) (measuring income/wealth inequality). Technological progress might be measured by our ability to impact the universe, the physical world around us.\n\n### Happiness\nHappiness isn’t necessarily highest in the places with the most technological progress\n\nIs it wrong to try to measure progress in terms of people's happiness? What about the hedonic treadmill, will we eventually just regress to a new 'normal'?\n\n## Hedonic Treadmill\n\u003e \"Improvement in my life — should I not desire it or should I not be in need of improvement? I really want to improve. But it’s precisely because I yearn for it that I’m afraid of remedies that are worse than the disease.\" (Van Gogh, 1879)\n\n## A humanistic take\n[Source](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22652782/roots-of-progress-jason-crawford)\n\n\u003e Progress is anything that helps human beings live better lives: longer, happier, healthier, in mind, body, and spirit.

Exits create incentives for upfront funding, hiring, motivation and alignment through equity, a share in the exit. However, for nonprofits, FOSS, and public goods projects, this “light at the end of the tunnel” does not exist.\n\n[Source (Retroactive Public Goods Funding)](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c)\n\n## Definitions\nPublic goods are\n1. non-excludable: it’s extremely difficult to stop someone from using the good, like roads and bridges\n2. non-rivalrous:  it’s abundant, and one person’s use of the good doesn’t substantially reduce the amount left for someone else (e.g. there’s more than enough air to go around)\n\nIt costs the same to produce for one person as it is for everyone else, and one cannot prevent people from accessing this.\n\nStatic [open source](posts/paid-open-source.md) (code that anyone can copy off the internet) is an example of a public good. Another example of these are public [infrastructure](thoughts/infrastructure.md) like roads (although not necessarily, if you have your drivers license revoked you may not be able to make use of the roads in the first place).\n\nIt seems only natural that online media archives and open digital [infrastructure](thoughts/infrastructure.md) should qualify as well.\n\nYet, no matter their claim to universality, instantiations of public goods are always _local_. The public cannot contain everyone. Locality is created and felt through [shared space, time, or experience]. It requires synchronicity of experience, rel: [group-limits](thoughts/group-limits.md)\n\nClub goods are excludable but non-rivalrous. A lot of more recent app launches (e.g. Dispo and Clubhouse) used waitlists to create 'fake scarcity' to transition from a public good to a club good.\n\n## Positive Sum Worlds\nhttps://otherinter.net/research/positive-sum-worlds/ and https://gitcoin.co/blog/seeking-a-new-kind-of-public-good/\n\nWe govern, share, and maintain [public goods] as a society. While imperfect in how they are built or administered, these objects draw us together in dialogue, debate, and common concern\n\nHow can we incentivize creation of public goods? Maybe through [quadratic funding](thoughts/quadratic-funding.md).\n\n### Defining 'public'\n\u003e The vernacular term \"public\" is understood to be _something of the people, freely available for use_—such as parks, roads, and common lands.\n\n\"**A public can be identified and classified by** **_shared problems_**, the extent to which they are aware of such problems, and the extent to which they do something about it.\" Similarly, how do we define a [community](thoughts/communities.md)?\n\nCrypto and [web3](toc/web3.md) overcome a lot of the bariers of web1 and web2, namely the inability to satisfy inalienable access to 'public' resources. The internet's so-called \"[public spaces](thoughts/digital-commons.md)\" are nothing like our cities' public parks. They are merely someone else's private server, where access can be revoked at will.\n\nPublic also means creating venues in which people could begin to identify themselves as part of a collective whole.\n\n\u003e To publish a web document or software application is more than making _something_ public: it's an act of making _a_ public (Warner, 2002)\n\n### Defining 'good'\n\"_Why_ are public parks more desirable than public parking lots? This brings us to an important realization: any definition of public goods presupposes a shared understanding of what is in the public's benefit, and why.\"\n\nThese 'goods' exemplify a set of shared values within the 'public'.\n\nAre there concepts of 'free riders' with public goods? What about [tragedy of the commons](thoughts/tragedy-of-the-commons.md)? \"It is clearly in the interest of society to promote the creation and consumption of public goods—be they vaccines, public libraries, or open source code\"\n\n## [Web3](toc/web3.md)\nhttps://otherinter.net/research/positive-sum-worlds/\n\nCrypto protocols are one of the most compelling novel institutional forms, specifically deriving from their \"public\" qualities\n1. unrestricted membership + participation\n2. open APIs\n3. transparent allocation of resources and pwoer\n\nYet not perfect\n* Ownership of these resources are concentrated in a precious few (whales)\n* The 'public' that this infrastructure serves is mostly decentralized finance\nBoth of these main tokeholders share one common concern: price\n\n### 'Voice' in web3\n\"The equivalence of stake and voice in crypto is reminiscent of early American democracy, in which political representation was conditioned on property ownership. Under this regime, only 6% of the total US population was eligible to vote—a laughably exclusionary idea of the body politic by today's standards (Ratcliffe, 2013)\"\n\n\"The most consequential members of the crypto-public today are those who hold the most tokens, meaning even small holders are effectively removed from the conversation about what's in their benefit.\" Same concepts as [design justice](thoughts/books/design-justice.md), we need to talk with and consider the marginalized peoples under existing systems of power so we can gain a deeper understanding of the public that we are building for and how to best serve them.\n\n## Obessions with profit\nWeb3 supposed allows us to 'codify' the set of values that a public goods represents. Yet, in practice in web3, \"little space has been made for different values to be discussed or enacted. Which is why, in the absence of ways to enact our shared values, we default to the lowest common denominator: profit.\"\n\nThe United States Dollar does not have a responsibility to profit its holders.

Books, with some effort, can help you learn to walk, but only people can help you orient where to walk. In other (equally vague yet obvious) words, I can’t know (through books), if I don’t know what to know (through people). (quote from eva)\n3. organizing thoughts\n\nI used to think that to be a productive member of society, one just had to put their head down and try to churn out as much output as possible. I very much subscribed to the belief that if I just kept constantly producing new things, I would eventually learn from my mistakes and improve rapidly. I found that while, yes, this approach allowed me to build my technical skills really quickly, I applied it to everything — even things that didn't need it. I held a metaphorical hammer in my hands and everything seemed like a nail.\n\nOver the summer, I began to read again. I started with technical write-ups, fiction novels, traversed into self-help, and to memoirs. I started to read more about the state of the world and critically discuss these with family and friends. Reading helped me colour in the lines as to [*why* we need to build](/thoughts/value-setting) in the first place. I realized that the problems we try so hard to solve with technology are not tech problems, but human ones.\n\nI've started to write more about these ideas, at first to help me organize my own thoughts, but eventually segued into an excuse for me to talk to people about interesting ideas and get their perspective. It's started a sort of chain reaction in a sense, with an observation from a book leading to a conversation with a friend to a blog post ad infinitum — leading me to be a more informed and curious individual.\n\nhttps://www.briantimar.com/notes/mimetic/mimetic/\nSpeaking with authors through their written work triggers the same neural circuits that produce imitation of desire. By stocking a bookshelf judiciously, you can express a preference over preferences — “what should I value? What do I want to spend my waking hours thinking about?” — and act on it through careful, honest reading. This engineering is safe: most authors exert their influence slowly, over hundreds of pages, and if the effect turns out to be undesirable, you need only put the book down. It’s cheap and reliable — if you want to emulate someone, start by reading what they read. Most importantly, it’s _powerful_, because authors form a large part of the meta-peer group that determines which communities and games you engage with.","title":"Reading"},"/thoughts/representation":{"content":"---\ntitle: \"Representation\"\ndate: 2021-07-02T15:33:29-04:00\n---\n\n# Crane\n## Symbolic Representation\n-   mans just kinda doesn't agree w/ the pioneer 10 space probe plate lmao\n    -   symbols will not mean anything to any alien life\n    -   we find it easy to understand because we have the context and we live on this planet\n-   words do not have meaning in and of themselves (no intrinsic meaning)\n-   what sort of things can be representations\n    -   words/pictures/numbers/diagrams\n    -   state of mind, can represent almost anything at all\n-   what sort of things can be objects of representations\n    -   almost anything (physical objects, sentences, numbers, moods, feelings, emotions, non-existent things)\n    -   pictures represent by resemblance → derivative intention\n        -   ‘resemblance theory of pictorial representation’, or the 'resemblance theory'\n        -   WC ant argument, resemblance is not enough for reference\n-   X represents Y → suggests that representation is a relation between two things\n-   is there a basic type of representation underlying everything else?\n    -   crane says mental representations are the most basic level\n    -   pictures dont work\n        -   represent by resemblance\n        -   When we try to represent the difference between … and …, if … then …, and either … or … in pictures, we draw a complete blank.

Conceptual design (in early design)\n    -   basic 'wireframe' of design representation and interaction sequences on these tasks, emphasizing user \"mental model\"\n    -   each design should account for the expected user knowledge and motivation, where it takes into consideration the real world contexts of real users\n4.

This is the point of [participatory design](thoughts/books/design-justice.md).\n\nThe main principles of **user-centered design** (Gould and Lewis) are as follows:\n1. Early focus on users and tasks: Understanding who users will be (cognitive, behavioural, anthropomorphic, and attitudinal characteristics) and observing users doing normal tasks, studying nature of normal tasks, involving users in design process.\n2. Empirical measurement: early in development, get reactions and performance of intended users to scenarios/manuals/etc. Then, later in development, get reactions and performance of users to simulations and prototypes. Where possible, specific usability and UX goals should be identified, clearly documented and agreed upon at the beginning of the project which can help designers choose between alternative designs and check on progress.\n3. Iterative design: when problems are found in user testing, they are fixed, then more tests and observations carried out to see effects of fixes. This allows the design to be refined based on feedback\n\nBenefits:\n1. Expectation management: ensuring that the users' expectations of the new product are realistic and no surprises for users when the product arrives.\n2. Ownership: users who are involved and feel that they have contributed to a product's development are more likely to feel a sense of ownerships toward it and support its user\n\nThe process of this is the [double diamond design](thoughts/double-diamond-design.md).\n\n### Participation\nWide participation helps bring different perspectives to the process, which enhances design itself, produces more user satisfaction with the final product, and engenders a sense of ownership.\n\n**Participatory/cooperative/co-design** is an overarching design philosophy that places stakeholders as central actors in creation activities.

process from changing platforms to _protocols_; the difference being that, in protocols, there is no central appeal.\n\n### Web1,  Information Economy [1980s to 2000s]\nInternet services were built on open protocols that were controlled by the internet community. Develops could generally rest assured that these protocols wouldn't change much because they were commonly agreed on by the community. \n\n### Web2, Platform Economy [2000s to 2020s]\nInternet as we know it today, companies that provide services in exchange for your personal data. Web2 enabled us to enjoy P2P interactions on a global scale, but always with a middleman: a platform acting as a trusted intermediary between two people who do not know or trust each other.\n\nGeneral migration from open services to more sophisticated, centralized services\n\nEffects include frequent incursions on personal privacy, the spread of misinformation, and the ‘attention economy,’ all of which have fundamentally changed how we relate to one another, and destabilized civic engagement and labor across industries. [Source](https://gitcoin.co/blog/seeking-a-new-kind-of-public-good/)\n\n### Web3, Token Economy [2020s to present]\nDecentralized apps (usually running on the blockchain).\n\nMajor benefits:\n1. Anyone on the network can use the service (no one can block/deny you access to the service)\n2. Payments are built in (ether or ETH)\n3. Turing complete\n4. Require no personal data\n5. High reliability: runs on decentralized network rather than a single backend\n\nLimitations\n1. Scalability/Speed: change to state need to be processed and propagated\n2. UX\n3. Fracturability: can happen when there are disagreements about protocol changes\n4. Cost: gas fees \n\n## Cool Applications\n### [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/)\nHow do we incentivize [open source software](posts/paid-open-source.md)? Gitcoin approaches this through decentralizing [funding](thoughts/funding.md) (away from corporations and toward individuals).\n\nNot just providing funding, 4 main value adds\n1. Earn -\u003e get paid to do maintenance work and upkeep of public goods!\n2. Learn -\u003e mentorship from industry leaders and peers\n3. Connect -\u003e creating a community of builders and support network\n4. Fund -\u003e making it easy for developers to support each other\n\n### [Golem](https://blog.golemproject.net/golem-primer/)\n\nTLDR: Golem democratizes society’s access to computing power by creating a decentralized platform where anyone can build a variety of applications, request computational resources and/or offer their idle systems in exchange for cryptocurrency tokens\n\n\u003eFrom large universities to scientists or artists, anyone can leverage the world’s unused computing power to conduct data intensive research and complex computations through the Golem Network","title":"Web3"}}
