In a sense, <em>Catalog</em> and <em>Supplement</em> became town squares.</p><p>Much as the dancers at the Trips Festival had imagined that LSD would allow them to escape their bodies and enjoy a new form of communion, scholars and reporters began to describe computer-mediated communication as a form of interaction in which bodies had ceased to matter.</p><h3 id=comprehensive-designers>Comprehensive Designers</h3><p><a href=/thoughts/contact-language rel=noopener>Contact Language</a>
which to exchange ideas and techniques in linguistically distinct tribes (e.g. scientists, technologists, and administrators)</p><p>Contact Language: broadly speaking, this language served to facilitate collaboration across the groups it interconnected.</p><p>&ldquo;The Comprehensive Designer not only did not need to don a gray flannel suit when he went to work; he actually needed to become an artist and intellectual migrant. To a generation preoccupied with the fear of becoming lockstep corporate adults on the military model of Brand&rsquo;s imagined Soviet Army, Buckminster Fuller offered a marvelously playful alternative&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How you get energy is, you take polarities and slap them next to one another. If you get into cybernetics and your head is just a minute ago full of organic gardening and ecology, then cybernetics starts to come alive for you in a different way.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=network-forums>Network Forums</h3><p>Network Forum &ndash; a palce where members of different communities come together, exchanging ideas and legitimacy, and in the process, synthesizing new intellectual frameworks and new social networks.
Joins Peter Galisons' notion of the &ldquo;trading zone&rdquo; and Susain Leigh Star and James Griesemer&rsquo;s &ldquo;boundary object&rdquo;
Trading Zone -> sites where representatives of multiple disciplines come together to work and, as the ydo, establish contact languages for purposes of collaboration
Boundary Objects -> objects which both inhabit several intersecting social worlds and satisfy the informational requirements of each (e.g. maps, diagrams, standardized forms, notation, etc.)</p><p>Network entrepreneur: one who migrates from one intellectual community to another and, in the process, to knit together formerly separate intellectual and social networks.</p><p>&ldquo;We thought of the WEC as a print version of what the Internet was going to be&rdquo;</p><h3 id=computational-metaphor>Computational Metaphor</h3><p>On the computational metaphor (seeing everything as computation)
&ldquo;We are compiling a vocabulary and a syntax that is able to describe in a single language all kinds of phenomenon that have escaped a common language until now. It is a new universal metaphor. It hasm ore juice in it than previous metaphors: Freud&rsquo;s dream state, Darwin&rsquo;s variety, Marx&rsquo;s progress, or the Age of Aquarius. And it has more power than anything else in science at the moment. In fact the computational metaphor may eclipse mathematics as a form of universal notation.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Society as a whole, as well as its constituent organizational parts, functioned much like organisms and machines.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The principles governing the world of the soft &ndash; the world of intagibles, of media, of software, and of services &ndash; will soon command the world of the hard &ndash; the world of reality, of atoms, of objects, of steel and oil, and the hard work done by the sweat of brows.&rdquo; &ndash; New Rules for the New Economy</p><p>Technocracy, technostructure, or technological society: society&rsquo;s rapid process of centralization and rationalization as both supported by new technologies and designed to help build them.</p><p>Sante Fe Institute: founded in 1984 by a group of scientists who had come to believe that since WWII, the biological, physical, and socila sciences had begun to converge. Computers, they argued, had made this convergence possible in two ways: first, they had served as tools for examining and modeling the world, and, second, the algorithms with which they organized information mimicked the algorithmic patterning of life itself by means of biological &ldquo;technologies&rdquo; such as DNA.</p><h3 id=neocolonialism>Neocolonialism</h3><p>&ldquo;[The hippie&rsquo;s] arrival tapped into memories of very old patterns of colonization and migration. A chicano member of New Mexico&rsquo;s Reality Construction Company commune told a visiting reporter, &lsquo;every time a white hippie comes in a buys a Chicano&rsquo;s land to escape the fuckin&rsquo; city, he sends that Chicano <em>to</em> the city to go through what he&rsquo;s trying to escape <em>from</em>, can you dig it?&mldr; Then when that money&rsquo;s gone, see, the Chicano has to <em>stay</em> in the city, cause now he ain&rsquo;t got no land to come back to.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=power-hierarchies-and-individualism>Power Hierarchies and Individualism</h3><p>&ldquo;Brand suggests that top-down politics (i.e. the kind where Mr. Advantage tells Mr. Disadvantage what to do) is backrupt. The center of change must be the individual, acting with other likeminded individuals. This emphasis on local action echoes the notion of the individual&rsquo;s local role in maintaining universal systems.&rdquo;</p><p>WEC seems to promote an incredibly individualistic approach; Indians must work with Indians, the Third World with the Third Wolrd, blacks with blacks, and so on. No group should count on help from any other&mldr; Such segregation might seem to conflict with the WEC&rsquo;s celebration of &lsquo;whole&rsquo; systems. This seems to be an artifact of the fact that all members of the WEC were white and relatively young, iwth a high level of education and easy access to social and financial resources.</p><p>&ldquo;The great machines of empire had been miniturized and turned over to individuals, and so transformed into tools with which individuals could improve their own lives.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As a variety of economic sociologists have noted, the mid-1980s saw hierarchical firms in many industries and several nations reorganize themselves as project oriented networks. They laid off workers, broke component elements of firms into semi-independent project teams, and decentralized their management structure.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Although the hive had a queen, he pointed outm it was governmed by the rule-driven behaviour of its many memebers. In the hive one could see &lsquo;the true democracy and all distributed governance&rsquo;. One could also see the faded image of New Communalism. Leveled, collaborative, linked by invisible signals and shared feelings, Kelly&rsquo;s hive was a sort of natural commune.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Together, <em>Wired</em> suggested, this digital generation would do what the New Communalists had failed to accomplish: they would tear down hierarchies, undermine the sorts of corporations and governments that had spawned them, and, in the hierarchies' place, create a peer-to-peer, collaborative society, interlinked by invisible currents of energy and information.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The urge to &lsquo;hack&rsquo; politics by bringing governance down to a mangeable local level and by basing social integration on technologically facilitated forms of consciousness was one of the driving impulses behind the New Communalist movement&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In many industries today, and in some parts of military and academic life as well, hierarchies have been replaced by flattened structures, long-term employment by short-term, project-based contracting, and professional positions by complex, networked forms of sociability.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=hackers>Hackers</h3><p>Hackers -> those who figured things out as they went and invented for pleasure. Focused on computer systems themselves and on seeing what they could do</p><p>Planners -> those who pursued problems according to a set and less flexible strategy. Thought of computers as tools that oculd be used to generate or model infomration</p><p>Steven Levy&rsquo;s definitions:
A hack -> a project undertaken or a product built not solely to fulfill some constructive goal, but with some mild pleasure take in mere involvement</p><h3 id=media-labs>Media Labs</h3><p>&ldquo;The sponsors were not allowed to demand that any particular reserach be done on their behalf. Rather, they were buying permission to watch as [they built]&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Media Lab personnel were never required to produce artifiacts that could be mass-produced or that would feede directly into sponsors' lines of business per se. Instead, they were expected to produce &lsquo;demos.'&rdquo;</p><h3 id=misc>Misc</h3><p>&ldquo;I always thought tools were objects, things: screw drivers, wrenches, axes, hoes. Now I realize that tools are a process: using the right-sized and shaped object in the most effective way to get a job done.&rdquo;</p><p>On CompuServe and elsewhere, developers largely treated information as a commodity to be exchanged and users as consumers of information goods</p><p>&ldquo;Biological life does not want to keep speeding up like a chip design, cycling ever faster year by year.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Behind the fantasy of unimpeded information flow lies the reality of millions of plastic keyboards, silicon wafers, glass-faced monitors, and endless miles of cable.
