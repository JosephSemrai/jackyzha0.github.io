Why then, have they become increasingly corporate places of extraction of free labour?</p><p>This cooptation of hacker culture, hackathons as design sites in particular, by neoliberalism has been on the back of my mind ever since reading the chapter on design sites in Design Justice. As someone who first got their footing in computer science through hackathons, it pains me to see that this is the rep that hackathons have slowly gotten over time, moving from safe spaces for idea exploration to increasingly corporate, time-bound, events where hackers spin up apps to test company products in exchange for the slim chance of winning prizes and recognition.</p><p>Hackathons reshape precarious and unpaid work. Writing code and building apps for free becomes an extraordinary opportunity and a collective imagination for fictional expectations of innovation that benefits all. Do we so necessarily need to tie these rituals of play in building and tinkering to the recruiting and product testing pipeline for large corporations?</p><p>As a hackathon organizer, Design Justice has helped me to more actively think about what hackathons are trying to motivate. Having more of the tools to articulate and locate exactly why hackathons have felt increasingly corporate is the first step to reinstate hackathons as third spaces not as places of creation or competition, but as places of play and exploration.</p><h2 id=quotes>Quotes</h2><h3 id=defining-design-justice>Defining Design Justice</h3><p>How larger systems &ndash; including norms, values, and assumptions &ndash; are encoded in and reproduced through the design of sciotechnical systems.

By consistently ignoring the health, diet, and care needs of diverse attendees, along with needs based on skill, class, and gender identities, hackathons create an exclusive and hostile environment.&rdquo;</p><h4 id=hackathons-the-good>Hackathons: The Good</h4><p>They are often crucibles of intense and focused learning, making, problem-solving, communtiy building, and play.</p><p>&ldquo;In the old days people used to form teams and rush in and try to fix things, without really even knowing what was broken &mldr; it is no longer just a bunch of programmers in a room. There are now hackathons where actual community members are learning to code and interacting. &mldr; Community members are also teaching programmers about the things they need to sustain and build for the future. That&rsquo;s a really good thing happening&rdquo;</p><p>Such hackathons push hackers to reflect on why they are doing the work they do, push for the ideas and welfare of marginalized communities in the tech sphere, and do so on the terms of their wellbeing and safety.</p><p>Organizers should pay attention to participants as whole human beings.

It is not meant to be a <em>filter</em> that we use to eliminate most design possibilities from consideration because they fail an accessibility checklist. In fact, design justice as a framework is meant to do the opposite: to act not as a funnel that we use to limit ourselves to a minimal set of supposedly universal design choics, but rather as a prism through which to generate a far wider rainbow of possible choices, each better tailored to reflect the needs of a specific group of people.</p></div></article><div><hr><script
