.</p><p>I strongly believe that <strong>code can&rsquo;t abstract responsibility away from problems</strong>. I spend a lot of time thinking about how to improve hackathon culture as a part of

and how to use technology ethically to make our world better with

It takes advantage of Go templates in order to generate the site from just a few config files! Now, updating the site is as simple as editing a YAML file. Continous integration and deployment done through Github Actions.</p><ul class=lt-hl><li>Hugo</li><li>lite.css</li><li>Github Actions</li></ul></div></div><div class=lang_bar><span class=tooltiptext>JavaScript, HTML, SCSS</span><div class="bar_container lt-flex-col"><div style="background-color:#f1e05a;flex:0 0 35%"></div><div style="background-color:#e34c26;flex:0 0 35%"></div><div style="background-color:#c6538c;flex:0 0 30%"></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class=lt-centre><footer><p>made by Jacky Zhao, © 2021</p><a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/jackyzha0.github.io>source</a><a href=https://twitter.com/_jzhao>twitter</a></footer></div><script src=https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js></script><script>const isReducedMotion=window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)').matches
