Zooko&amp;rsquo;s Triangle Postulates that names of participants can have at most 2 of these 3 properties
Human-meaningful: Meaningful and memorable (low-entropy) names are provided to the users. Secure: The amount of damage a malicious entity can inflict on the system should be as low as possible. Decentralized: Names correctly resolve to their respective entities without the use of a central authority or service.</description></item><item><title>Creation vs Maintenance</title><link>https://jzhao.xyz/thoughts/creation-vs-maintenance/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jun 2021 15:07:59 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jzhao.xyz/thoughts/creation-vs-maintenance/</guid><description>So much of today&amp;rsquo;s society revolves around creating new things rather than maintaining existing things. Yet, the two go hand in hand - innovation without the ability to scale and maintain is frivolous, and maintenance without innovation is stagnation.
There is importance in indigenous knowledge and tradition.

https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/06/the-internet-is-a-collective-hallucination/619320/: &amp;ldquo;Of course, there’s a keenly related problem of permanency for much of what’s online. People communicate in ways that feel ephemeral and let their guard down commensurately, only to find that a Facebook comment can stick around forever. The upshot is the worst of both worlds: Some information sticks around when it shouldn’t, while other information vanishes when it should remain.</description></item><item><title>Labels and Quantization</title><link>https://jzhao.xyz/thoughts/labels-and-quantization/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 May 2021 22:22:23 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jzhao.xyz/thoughts/labels-and-quantization/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Accuracy is more useful in entry-level jobs and for novices, because as skill increases, quantification of skill becomes harder.&amp;rdquo;

Not only does it have some absolutely stunning cover art, it also touches on some thoughts that have been marinating in my head about the intersection of open source and funding. So much so, that I’ve started experiencing the Baader-Meinhof effect, seeing something to do with open source and funding everywhere I look in tweets, conversations, and blogs.</description></item><item><title>Hackathons</title><link>https://jzhao.xyz/thoughts/hackathons/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Feb 2021 12:01:16 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://jzhao.xyz/thoughts/hackathons/</guid><description>Full Post -&amp;gt; hackathons Design Justice hackathons becoming very corporate traces the cooptation of hacker culture by neoliberalism what is neoliberalism -&amp;gt; basically let the market decide everything &amp;ldquo;For example, consider the transformation of agriculture from Indigenous knowledge of small-scale planting, harvesting, and land-management techniques to modern agribusiness with monocultures, pesticides, fertilizers, and roboticized megafarms&amp;rdquo; hackerspaces were described as originally being &amp;ldquo;third spaces&amp;rdquo; outside of the logic of both the communist state and the capitalist market &amp;ldquo;at the same time, without intentional intervention, these spaces find it very difficult to fulfill even their own liberal democratic rhetoric, because they end up dominated by white cis men and by middle-class people with free time and disposable income&amp;rdquo; [hackathons] are understood by corporate managers as potentially effectives ways to identify new talent, and therefore as a possible mechanism in the tech sector hiring pipeline hackathons provide excellent opportunities for the extraction of free labour the assumption that a &amp;ldquo;hackathon for good&amp;rdquo; will be successful if it produces a new app the can help &amp;ldquo;solve a social problem runs deep&amp;rdquo; they nearly always focus on problems and rarely build on existing community assets; and people think hackathons can do things that they usually can&amp;rsquo;t, such as solve big or even little problems, create new products overnight, or &amp;lsquo;level the playing field&amp;rsquo; of innovation through meritocracy urban design and urban planning &amp;ldquo;through such initiatives, city administrators signal that the public is invited to participate in decisionmaking on an ongoing basis, not only at the ballot box every few years&amp;rdquo; -&amp;gt; in response to city government being more transparent, more administrative data being made available to the public, and administrators actively seeking ideas from engaged publics about how to improve government services and city resident&amp;rsquo;s quality of life neoliberal, technocentric ideas about the city as a machine or as a software system waiting to be optimized have become increasingly prominent citizens should not be reduced to users through the lens of neoliberal governmentality diversity and inclusivity broader availability of digital design and fabrication increases the opportunity for community-controlled design processes that include more diverse users and user stories, with more equitable and inclusive distribution of affordances the assumption that making sites &amp;ldquo;open&amp;rdquo; makes them inclusive, without specifically addressing race, class, gender, and/or disability dynamics, is common to many privileged design sites such hackathons [more inclusive hackathons] push hackers to reflect on why they are doing the work they do, push for the ideas and welfare of marginalized communities in the tech sphere, and do so on the terms of their wellbeing and safety for example, this means that it is important to consider food, bio beaks, accessible bathrooms that are friendly to all body types and genders, comfortable spaces to nap or relax, and decent lighting hackathon spaces cultivate a culture that marginalizes hackers with specific needs, including but not limited to women, people with disabilities, people with non-traditional backgrounds, and even individuals with specific dietary restrictions &amp;ldquo;Steer students away from the pitfalls of tech solutionism and technochauvanism&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Make all people good coders, or make all coders good people&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s true that design justice practitioners have to take care that critique does not become our primary activity; an overemphasis on testing, evaluation, and critique can indeed by ultimately disempowering&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;However if resource constraints become an excuse to avoid examining the root of the problem area, then designers will almost always end up, at best, providing Band-Aids for deep wounds and, at worst, actively serving existing power structures&amp;rdquo;
